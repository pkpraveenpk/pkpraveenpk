       "'The oldish man who owns the store is as sweet as can be Perhaps sweeter than the cookies or ice cream Here s the lowdown Giant ice cream cookie sandwiches for super cheap The flavor permutations are basically endless I had snickerdoodle with cookies and cream ice cream It was marvelous Un fortunately for me lux is close to my house I walk there nearly every day and am much poorer because of it The coffee and pastries are amazing They always play really great music too Fred M pretty much said what I would say so I won t beat a dead horse I ll add though that they offer a wide variety of deep fried quesadillas Did you catch that DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS I absolutely love this little spot It s a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that I don t have to drive clear out to Scottsdale to find I ve been shopping at Vignettes for about years Whenever I am in a quandary about what to get someone this is the first place that I head to Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand Whether it s something for the garden a gift for the new bride or baby a unique piece of art or heavenly scented candles you will not be disappointed The owners staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion need And they do the most amazing wrap jobs making gift giving even easier The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet Good food good service no complaints Still have never made it here for happy hour but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal The staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another I ve only ever eaten sushi here but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh I would recommend trying this restaurant AZ is at once chic urban fun and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face as a t shirt and jeans wearing overweight guy You ll first notice the atmosphere and with good reason it s perfectly lit with noticeable but not mind numbingly blaring music and even better they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday Saturday evening dining experience When I first hit AZ it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers Overall a very different fun look Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound and while they typically have a rock steady delivery more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend s purse to her chagrin That aside the food is fantastic and even though it s a bit hard to get out of here for under per person because you simply must try the cheesecake and drinks are pushing it s worth it as a classy but casual night out that you can really enjoy They have a great patio the burger is dripping with flavor and in fact cheese and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything Great salads and sandwiches help round things out and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you ll have the good chance to try Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense these people know how a cheesecake is done It is rich thick with just a hint of sour and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom Overall a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them in good humor or as appropriate not We ve never run afoul of that rule but you wouldn t want to I assure you Who dosen t like Cosco I love this place The pizza is cheap and good A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night The food service was great I think we scared our poor server Mike but he was wonderful I love this restaurant even though it s a chain and I can hear my brother saying it s just a glorified Red Lobster I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon stuffed with crab shrimp and brie cheese which was unbelievably amazing I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious but could barely breathe after eating all that food The service was outstanding although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying I can t wait to come back here The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix It is light airy and tasty and does not give you that I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour feeling The ingredients are fresh and delicious I am hooked Great Mexican food Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes Halibut tacos remind me of Ensenada Michelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish This was the first real ballet I have ever been to and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning When I walked in I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures The bartenders we bought our drinks from was very friendly and accomodating I can t say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers the sets the costumes etc Just incredible I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season Great service After a year in the Valley one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar I really like the atmosphere It was sleek yet cozy The night we went in it was hopping but not overly crowded A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded pretentious Scottsdale hotspots As I get older I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill Also I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause SideBar is just that kind of establishment If anyone is on Twitter follow buzzcation SideBarphx has let buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours It s a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples I ve been a bunch of times for takeout and took a seriously picky foodie friend this past weekend Everything I ve had here has been excellent and I mean excellent In the past I ve had the margherita pizza eggplant parm and fried calamari All good This weekend we had the comp tapenade beef carpacchio lasagna and one of the pizzas can t remember name had olives art hearts ham and All delicious The lasagna was so delicate but melded perfectly with the sauce My very particular picky friend LOVED the place Seriously loved it As good as it gets We ate here for a birthday celebration and we were taken away by the great food and service as usual We requested the V Lounge and were given a nice corner booth When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant a very nice touch For appetizers we had oysters and the best crab cakes anywhere Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine Overall just incredible Completely up to par with Eddie V s standards comparing to Houston and Austin My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her We also got a follow up phone call the next day asking how everything went For those special occasions or a fun happy hour Eddie V s never lets you down Also their Banana s Foster is divine Save room for it or just stuff your face and go to the gym the next day delish Still stars but sadly Amber is closing up shop Don t feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her Damn her I did pick up some jeans and shirts all at off So hurry over and pick up some bargains And wish Amber good luck Called these guys when an evap cooler water pressure line at my office burst A guy with a clean white shirt tucked in to his pants introduced himself to me assessed my problem and quoted a very fair price to fix it This guy was way too clean personable and professional to be the plumber He went right to work and had everything back to normal for me in no time You have to understand I am use to a dirty loud intrusive plumber that smiles with his butt These guys won me over and their telephone number is in my cell phone now I highly recommend Palmer s Plumbing Eating in is a decent experience but for delivery I have yet to meet their match When I order delivery I always get a chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top and for the last years I have received it in minutes or less all but times Its always tasty fresh and is my preeminent food for delivery ever period Sportsman s is on top of the game when it comes to wine The staff is more knowledgeable and helpful than any other place that I have bought wine at before I didn t feel like I was being judged for trying to find a cheaper bottle and there was no pretentiousness in the air While I was inquiring about dry resling one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar and came back with TWO samples for me to try Sportsman s also has a very intriguing liquor section I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of Several times a month they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled They also have a full service restaurant bar off to the side where they have a huge by the glass list you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store they cork it free of charge and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner The portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them My one complaint is petty their website Its overrun with text and finding important information is difficult it also needs to be better updated with their amazing tasting events This is my favorite hotel of all time so far at least of the Kimpton ilk I experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed organic and local products a lovely shower and general happy relaxation I love that the gym and pools are open hours a day The decor half Asian deco and half Southwestern works works works This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that good This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill The cherry on top is the games they have to offer Bocce and Bags Drinks Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order made with Vodka Ginger beer and fresh lime juice If you bring in your own pimp cup any size They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup Food VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i ve ever had so I highly recommend getting them I moved from Philly this past summer and I ve searched all over the Valley for a GOOD Pizza After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia I love the hole in the wall vibe Just like home The sauce is great and super tasty The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy It s what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven I love it My husband and I order the pizza wing special The wings are so hot and spicy we order the hot but it comes in buffalo and mild They have an extensive menu of pasta sandwiches and salads I want to try their Philly Steak next but for the time being I still make mine at home Every pizza place likes to say its New York Style but this place really does a NYC pizza Well the best nyc pizza you re gonna get in AZ Something about the water Oh YEAH Coming to Scottsdale I have used RedSeven in Tempe and Mesa and excited to know that they are coming to Scottsdale I work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in Scottsdale that I continue to brag to them about RedSeven s Super Quick Service Getting the job done quick and right and guaranteed to be the fastest to get you back to work Oh and they talk to you so you can understand not computer talk Can t wait for Scottsdale Yup I m reviewing a gas station I like the Quiktrip chain in general and this station in particular I find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town Sure the Arco sign down the street might say it s cents gallon cheaper but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge not to mention there s all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop With Quiktrip the place is well lit there s always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump the convenience store is better than most and unlike most other gas stations they don t charge you for the air compressor Oh and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door while managing to sound sincere about it Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what Bonus for those of you who enjoy shopping at the Hot Chick Safeway down the street this is the Hot Chick Gas Station Tried going there for my st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup They may be closed for good Not sure I love you Marquee Theatre Just last night I saw Dashboard Confessional here and it was packed I have seen many shows here and I have not a single complaint about The Marquee The bartenders are really friendly the bouncers do a great job and the bands they have play here are always phenomenal Not to mention the sound guys do an awesome job I love how big it is in the Marquee because it allows for tons of people to see a great show One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there The only thing I hate and this has nothing to do with The Marquee itself is that I am always standing next to belligerently drunk annoying girls who can t seem to keep their mouths shut during a set Please don t speak I am listening to Chris Carrabba s angelic voice thanks All in all I think that The Marquee Theatre is my favorite venue of all time Their food was GREAT I had the pancit lumpia and that purple rice The price was not bad for the amount of food that they gave you Even though they had a very long line they were still very fast with service OK yeah everyone LOVES teriyaki we know Well don t so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here It may look like a little pre processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside but they re a die hard home made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment I d highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ yet they have an excellent one that s very traditional but not too expensive I d love to explain the mystique of this dish but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that s coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable Well to them I say you should educate your tongue and expose it to some delicious culture There s also Orange chicken This dish is completely the bee s knees It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers Their house beef Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms Heaven Simple and delicious And I haven t even mentioned their coup de grace yet Their fried rice might seem a little heavy on the surface as it s lightly fried with some garlic oil but it outclasses all competitors Paired with their lightly fried shrimp it s sweet garlic love Seriously their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices As I ve been eating here for far longer than I d like to admit I d have to say I might be a little biased But for the great unique quality and cheap price I guarantee you re not going to find any better in AZ Video Paradise is great For those who aren t financially comfortable enough for the monthly payment to maintain a NetFlix account or when you don t feel like buying something from Amazon com Video Paradise is a wonderful substitute if you want to get something that you know won t be at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video The selection is staggering I remember the first time I stepped in I was amazed The only movie I really wanted to see and they didn t have was The Helstrom Chronicle but that s okay I m not going to ding this place because they didn t have it You didn t have The Helstrom Chronicle Lame I mean come on No one else has it This place had it all from little indie films to gross out horror films I had long forgotten from my disturbing adolescence Cannibal Holocaust Faces of Death etc They even had the worst movie I d ever seen in my life Hard Rock Zombies The d cor is that of sheer unbridled love for cinema You can easily spend hours and hours browsing through their selection Weekend plans prevented me from kicking off AZ Restaurant Week on Saturday So on Monday Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped We started out with the spinach artichoke dip The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I ve ever had the honor of putting in my mouth O M G Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness But when you hit a home run so soon in the game the rest of a meal can seem at odds However I was not daunted She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes with good gravy what exactly is that and roasted carrots I the blackened Mahi back story to follow topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous We didn t share our protein but we sampled each others sides All were very good but the carrots really stood out The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish we both hit the wall A food coma was certain I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots Then came the white chocolate brownie So sweet so rich so topped with vanilla ice cream It was all we could to to make a dent in it We both felt bad because isn t white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient Regardless this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles Having about myself I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read SWAG after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff Really super sorry if that creeped you out It s actually WCG When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit we went to a restaurant the listed Dolphin as one of its menu items I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin to which the server responded it was actually Mahi Oh I responded Then I ll have the veggie burger Because even in I was a food bitch This is the only auto repair place I ve ever seen with stars solid and they totally deserve it My boyfriend has a Pontiac Firebird that hasn t run in several years After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and to the awful Meineke down the street he gave up until my car s transmission went for good and he decided to fix the Bird yeah so I could drive it yes I am super lucky Whitey s diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel which is what Meineke charged to replace hmmm Upon hearing the story of Meineke Whitey s told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they d put it in for just labor Awesome We took it home but it wasn t running quite right still and then failed emissions Back to the shop it went Whitey s took it back spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things At one point they called and said We ve done this this and this and it s still not quite right so we re gonna keep it another day I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it versus just handing it back again but I was dreading the repair bill We picked it up Tuesday The bill That s right SEVEN DOLLARS They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter That is amazing to me I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time The car runs beautifully now and they were extremely pleasant the entire time I m taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week I HIGHLY recommend Whitey s This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot Pho real Impeccable service and the freshest food Their spring rolls ate immaculate fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice and their pho is truly unphoghetable The servers are friendly the owner always asks you how the food was Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine CASH ONLY But we easily feed a family of hungry people for less than and it s not Taco Bell So with that being said the Grilled Pork sandwich oh hell ya it s good ringing in at only The regular Turkey Ham on a crossaint is about and it s the size of a small football great value you could probalby get by with the small croissant sandwich instead for only yeah it s crazy cheap Hot wings are generic prebreaded with a kick of spiciness The steamed bun is sweet dough however not my favorite my husband and sister seem to love the egg and meat inside The ice cream is all homemade also another great deal at cents for a cone check out the icecream looks crazy good Don t miss out on taking home some baked goods the baguettes are crusty soft and warm when you get them The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley I did try and Avacodo boba had to send it back not sure what the heck it was it was green but didn t taste anything like Avacado so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas The Viet coffee also great kick for you mentally if you need a boost very strong very good Don t miss out on this place it s a good go to place for a great lunch or snack Here s the deal I said I was done with OT but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot My friend was right Everything I had a problem with before was remedied I went in unannounced didn t tell anyone about a previous bad experience and I was given some of the best service I ve received in town When we went in we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit No texting employees no indifferent waitstaff The chef was in the food window expediting food making sure it went out promptly and correctly Not only was our server attentive but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks debris on the table etc The decor has been refreshed and although I didn t dislike the decor originally it is definitely an upgrade as well Now its much cleaner but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before Props to the new management Well done I ll be back PS forgot to order side syrup Curious to see if they still charge Ben Jerry s is still the best chain ice cream shop The employees are always helpful and polite and their flavors are just outrageous The smell of the waffle cones and waffle bowls wafts out the doors as you walk by and you can t resist Whether you go for new flavors or classics like Cherry Garcia and Phish Food you can expect the most flavorful ice cream with the perfect consistency Even though I ve rarely had anything else on their menu except for hummus I highly recommend this little greek hot spot They have tons of regulars because the food keeps them coming back The hummus is to die for it only comes with one pita however so I always order extra I have also tried their veggie gyro which is great I have brought many meat loving friends here and I ve never heard anything but great things about their experience with their food The staff is completely Greek They are friendly in their own unique kind of way Because I usually saunter in with a drink from Starbucks same parking lot the female owner assumes I work there and she always asks me how business is going at SB I corrected her the first few times but she continued to ask so now I just keep it going and tell her it s going great but that I hate my job because I m assuming I would if I worked there I love her personality very intense Never smiles even when a smile would be just right But she is still very kind Always look forward to seeing her and eating her food I love this place I love that it s to go only no hour waits like Pizzaria Bianco and the mozzarella is mouth watering Please try the mozzarella tomato basil sandwich You won t regret it Total wine totally takes a crap on Bev Mo This store has everything The employees are also very knowledgeable The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling I don t like change So we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of Malbec The Malbec tasted amazing I was so happy For those of you who don t know it s not only wine You can find everything else Total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests Also don t forget to chill your bottles before you leave Woo Hoo Little Caesars opens in Fountain Hills Yummy pizza Covet is an excellent clothing store In Arizona there is almost nowhere decent to shop unless of course you loooooove Juicy Couture in the event of which you should probably not even bother reading this review because this kind of fashion forward clothing won t appeal to you Acne Jeans check Endovenera check Ksubi check Nike check Covet starts off with an excellent men s shoe section continues with an excellent men s clothing selection and finishes off with excellent women s wear It really is a shame if you haven t been to Covet yet Do yourself a serious favor and support a small business at the same time An oasis of little kid fun in Phoenix we hadn t been in over a year and came for a birthday party They re always running a deal so look for one before departing One year we did an annual pass It was a good deal There are also lots of special events that include deals One time we met spiderman There are lots of rides mostly for shorter kids Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall There s a train carousel mini coaster tea cup ride an up and down parachute ride several rides that go in circles in different vehicles e g planes cars and helicopters and futuristic flying machines and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides but not others and it also depends on the age of the child The place has a little bit of a rundown feel but kids don t notice and have loads of fun The arcade is really rundown but the ATM is really nice There isn t much shade so be prepared All of the staff are really nice There are usually a few game and art vendors about ball toss game sand art and or face painting All are a big hit with the kids but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece Everyone is a winner at ball toss by the way LOVE Chino Bandido The snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven Well all of the food might actually be heaven but usually by the time I get to the snickerdoodle I could die happy on the spot Our family have used this Discount Tire for years now Amazing service and warranty on tires Thank you Seriously I seldom give stars but it deserves at least this much If it wasn t for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene I would go every single day Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix My mouth is watering as I m thinking about the Hog Heaven special In fact my puppies mouths are watering too Decent prices giant selection One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate If you are a cracker family I suggest going super early like super early bird special early like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early because after dusk the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud super dicey Mexican Dance Club and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ Awesome place EXCELLENT food apps try the bleu cheese figs Ask for Dizzy Dre he s AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you Very patient with women I have been visiting Mrs White s going on years but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation I almost got cold feet Good thing I didn t The food is as awesome as ever The service is much as it has always been Be forewarned trendy restaurant goers who glom onto TV reviews Mrs White s is not trendy there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you The service is matter of fact no goofing around you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing this is the way it has always been at Mrs White s If you are looking for others to pamper you this is not the place for that Mrs White s is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food If you want Scottsdale ambiance again this joint won t work for you When you go be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit There are no corporate owned semi trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in minutes I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by they would be out of half of everything on the menu which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then Mrs White s was open Monday through Friday from till but I d swear you d be lucky to get anything after and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers I d just come back on another day To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations Funky little hole in the wall family run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn t always come wrapped in a sterile designer package then you might get along with Mrs White s I love this place and hope I always will I never write these things But I have to say that you will not be disappointed with Paletas Betty Especially with the weather right now it is a delicious and healthy treat made with seasonal ingredients I highly recommend the lim n amarillo when in season Delicious frozen lemondade lemon drop on a stick tossed in a sugar rub It is for certain served in heaven That is all P S check out the hours yo You know what s up My husband and I have been here twice in the last week for dinner it is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said around for dinner entrees but for vegetarian and organic food what exactly do folks expect You get what you pay for We were happily surprised after reading the reviews the food was amazing the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times and p s we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble despite the review about only paying cash Our first visit we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish For an appetizer we had the sabzi which is a huge plate of green herbs homemade wheat nan feta cheese and walnuts The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling For entrees we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that s agreeing with me I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said we can make it however you want every dish is made when you order it what the dishes are made to order I haven t heard that at a lot of restaurants After about minutes our stews arrived steaming hot and smelling delicious They were HEAVENLY So many flavors and so fresh Our second time here we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear a spinach dip both were ok but I like the Sabzi better The entrees we had were amazing I had a special of the day pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu which was blissful to smell and eat and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix Overall if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice organic foods dinner go here and check it out Everything will be fresh everything will smell and taste delicious and the restaurant s atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed decadent evening My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time I have nothing but good things to say Food wait staff and overall experience were excellent This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper leather booths etc If you haven t been I can t recommend it highly enough Give it a try and you ll be glad you did Ace and fried mushrooms at Casey s My version of heaven The food is good and the beer is even better but what people really go for is the ambiance The most awesome potpourri of people Old young but always interesting Say hi to Thomas the cat for me He s chilling with the patrons when ever it s not too crowded Top notch cheesesteak One of the best in the valley This place has a large delivery area and is located right by campus The owners are really nice and friendly I m really glad something moved into this spot It s so convenient Their desserts are great as well I wish they had some chicken options but they are new and said they would be adding to the menu as time goes on My girlfriend said the turkey sandwich was fantastic They sometimes carry Tasty Kake so ask about that I ve had the authentic cheesesteaks from Philly and this tastes every bit as good if not better It s definitely in my top local cheesesteaks Edit Just ordered delivery Lightning fast This place is incredibly legit I went with a cheesesteak with White American cheese instead of wiz this time So incredibly good They tossed in a new dessert they didn t have last time which was awesome Their prices are really good and their food is so delicious I m a huge fan I m not kidding with this star rating I love this place Rave rave rave we celebrated my birthday all weekend we made the trek to bobby q on sunday I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and let me tell you about that mac cheese it was amazing Mr H went with the chicken and brisket and for his sides beans and potato salad The food is sinfully delicious I will NOT be coming here as often as I would like I found it too indulgent it is definitely a treat and worth trying I love those little donuts they give you at the end What an amazing Mini Vacation I went in August which was about degrees but it was perfect The pool was relaxing the water felt great and I enjoyed all three nights of my stay We decided it was so great we never left the resort The Room was very clean and very comfortable Talavera had the most amazing Fish Entrees the seabase OMG I can still taste it the salmon was the best I have ever had and I dislike salmon completely The service through out the restaurant and hotel was amazing The special drinks they had were very tasty and made the degrees weather manageable The brunch buffet and breakfast at Crescent Moon is excellent all three days so fresh the pomegranate fresh juice was amazing I had three The food tasted like the items were freshly picked that morning I literally gained ILBs on this trip and it was worth all of it The Lounge had tasty small Tapas which I enjoyed while it drizzled that night the whole hotel has a great relaxing ambiance The nights were amazing to walk around the hotel or sit around the pool with the night lights on and enjoy the peacefulness of the resort I believe we saw bats flying around in the middle of the night which was very cool Worth every penny Just watch out for Camera Speed Traps on the way there Enjoy Delicious barbecue we had meats platter that we split with three people The pulled chicken is amazing the brisket tender and juicy the ribs succulent and flavorful best barbecue around The sides were delicious as well mac cheese was great mashed potatoes did not disappoint ranch beans aren t anything special but they tasted good Service was great waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order Atmosphere is good not too noisy quiet the lighting could be improved though a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating though the food wasn t there long enough to be seen Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs chicken brisket etc Excellent in every way Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night GREAT live music excellent wine selection Keeping Fountain Hills young one weekend at a time I have not been bowling in years so you can imagine i was worried But this place is clean and fresh On certain nights Monday and a few others you pay a cover charge then everything is Food drinks games and most important bowling games The instructions were easy We got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball Lots to choose from Lots of fun It was a night for of us The workers are very helpful and Friendly Bathrooms were also clean I did not see them spray the shoes with Lysol so that was a little gross But other than that it was a great time No attitude efficient lines clean well stocked with flat rate boxes and other sundries Is this USPS or a dream Writing Yelp reviews for post offices seems like weird or something but it feels so right for this location Private Karaoke at Geisha A Go Go is the coolest thing to hit Old Town in a while My girlfriends and I went this weekend and it was incredible I have heard a lot about karaoke being the new trend but not until I actually experienced it for myself did I understand why until now We had a private room with a flat screen TV and drinks at the flip of a switch um can you say bachelorette party It was so nice to have a night out without actually having to wait for drinks at a crowded bar or being able to hang out with your friends without random guys interrupting with a cheesy line to try to talk to you It was for an hour in a private room with of my best friends And by the time you split that between everyone it was well worth the extra expense Seriously once you try it you will be hooked too I can t wait to go back Stayed here for the RocknRoll marathon like of the guests and absolutely enjoyed my stay the hallways to the rooms were the only slightly blah decor all other things such as the bedrooms bathroom lobby restaurant and pools were great Amenities included pet fish that someone else fed complimentary granola for the race day smores for our firepit next to the pool nice wait staff that was pleasant and chatted us up super fast towel replenishment service girls use up a lot of towels great cabanas we never had a problem snagging one or two of them happy hour decent food delicious alcohol cool lobby area with lots of places to looooounge at dog friendly heated pools love it I will stay here again for sure I went to Peter Piper Pizza tonight to celebrate my daughter s th birthday It is a great place for kids to have fun Being a former employee of PPP I know that we could have had reservations for her birthday and had a party representative help with everything Unfortunately this was just a small family celebration So I ordered the big family meal deal which consisted of two large pizzas and an order of wings The pizza is always delicious to me it is not greasy like some of the pizza places out there We forgot to bring a lighter for the birthday candle so they had one on hand for us to borrow Needless to say this is a place that the kids love They can eat great pizza play which is all kids worry about This store used to be closer to th Ave Bell they have since moved and expanded a ton over the last few years Everything is made fresh daily ceviche guacamole salsa s they have pan dulce delivered every morning yummm You can pick up the old school soda s here and good Mexican Favs like Pinguinos Gansitos Duvalin Pelon Pelo Rico De Las Rosa and even Bimbo bread just to name a few thing s they carry here They have natural all organic small game hens that can be stuffed or bbq d you can ask for their rub they have all kinds of meat most get the Ranchera here for some carne asada you just need to be able to say how many Libras Pounds and you want them to make it Preparada they will put in their special marinade w oranges onions and spices in the bag If your a meat eater you cant go wrong here I cant get enough of this place Places like Made make me realize that there is hope for my life in Phoenix It is a cute converted house shop that carries a wide array of stuff that you won t find easily elsewhere There is lots of cute baby stuff that I would laugh at if I ever saw a baby wearing The jewelery is unique and cool it made me feel like I had etsy right in front of me live They have some good books around and some key David and Goliath pieces I heart places like Made so therefore I heart Made Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call The Slope Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes new and used No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard to find parts good service and free air that makes this place Love Love Love All you need to do is order dessert here It comes in small shot glasses the flavors explode in your mouth I just wanted to add that in addition to party and catering equipment they also rent heaps of tools and equipment Think hedge trimmers lawn aerators cement mixers stuff you might need for a once a year or special project and so don t want to invest in the equipment In our case we needed a chainsaw to take down some dead stuff from last winter s freeze an unwelcome sapling a dead tree branches encroaching the roof and to tame some monstrous oleanders I was just about to head to the tool rental department at that big box home improvement store when a friend mentioned A to Z I gave them a call and their prices were competitive Plus it had that feel good factor of being a local biz The process was pretty easy We got a thorough tutorial on chainsaw operation and safety and were on our way to some serious arboreal carnage Pro tip rent on Friday after pm You can return it Monday morning and only be charged for one day Saturday since they are closed on Sunday Okay so I have a little bit of bias towards Nordstrom I freaking love Nordstrom The store is always clean and the staff are always friendly I have never had such good service anywhere else I especially love that Nordstrom will return or exchange an item with no questions asked Aside from the service the selection is very nice I always go during the half yearly sale so that I can get some good deals on my designer duds I am big on shoes and the selection is very good They always have some cool shoes that I can t seem to live without Also the staff in the shoe department are very good on helping to make suggestions when I am not sure what I want If you go go in June or January when the sales are great Make sure you check out the shoes I was in Phoenix a few weeks ago on a business trip Lucky me Thai Elephant was right across the street from my hotel This is a tiny little joint maybe tables The menu is like a book there is so much to choose from rice dishes noodle dishes soups appetizers My coworker and I settled on a red curry dish with chicken and I had a sweet sour dish yeah it sounds trite but I was in the mood and it was so delicious We had tons of leftovers which we shared with a homey down the street I hope he enjoyed it Highly recommended and if I m ever back in town I will visit again I got the best KEEN hiking boots on sale here and they have a great selection of dog frisbee and dog boots and dog toys I like this location nobody bothers me and I can mill around without anyone bothering me They have anything from salads pitas wraps burgers and wood fired pizzas Although this isn t a plant based restaurant they pride themselves on having many vegan options Not only are there options but upon visiting their site I found a table of what items are vegan what aren t and what makes them non vegan which is always nice to know Great to have so many vegan options that are spelled out on their website We expected a counter service experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sit down restaurant The vibe was a classy yet laid back youthful feel Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes think Urban Outfitters style I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though it s a sit down experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling The food was absolutely FANTASTIC Oh my For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil lemon juice fresh garlic and smashed potatoes If you love garlic you ll love this My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices mixed greens tomatoes onions pickles and tahini He was very happy with his choice although next time he d ask for no onions I went with the Veggie Garden Wrap that included zucchini broccoli cauliflower eggplant yellow squash carrots onions tomatoes brown rice mixed beans ginger herbs and garlic One thing we quickly found was that our entrees were HUGE This is not a complaint in anyway However next go around we may share an entree Either way this visit we had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day Will definitely return How have I gone this long without reviewing the lodge Sheesh I get all fluttery inside when I think about the lodge The Mac and Cheese is not something to play around with It is a dish of fantastic cheesy wonderfulness Also please note the veggie wrap HOLY SMOKES Its a heavenly combo of sauteed veggies feta cheese and some kind of lemon herb heaven sauce all wrapped up in a pita Really Really Aaron May The other aspects of the lodge I enjoy involve the friendly staff and comfortable setting It s decorated all rustic and cushy and true to form there are antler chandeliers You will also find pool tables darts several TV s jenga bean bag games they have plenty going on at the lodge to keep you and your friends entertained Check it out Dude a happy hour that is TRULY happy This joint is relatively swank for all the deals it has Nice decor good bar FRESH seafood seriously this is some good quality Starting at p m they have martinis AND oysters YUM On top of that they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate a GIANT crab cake a salads and shrimp dishes All are tasty For all the Zoners out there yeah I said it you have to check out this place You will have a great time NOTE beware of dirty old men They ll hit on your friends So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barb s bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish Flatiron Mesa is one of my favorite hikes in the Phoenix area Like other reviewers have stated once you ve gotten used to Squaw and Camelback give this one a try It ll kick your ass It s about a climb in elevation so you re doing more like Camelbacks You ll be scrambling over boulders most of the way up since there really aren t switchbacks I d say give yourself about hours to go up and down It s inside Lost Dutchman State Park so you will need to pay an entry fee My one recommendation besides the obvious ones being fit pack food and water is to bring some light gloves Since you re climbing up and down on all those boulders your hands will probably get a little scratched up Don t feed the wildlife I m psycho for this place The sell cupcakes now Ollie Cake and have longer hours of operations I believe I want to say until NOM NOM NOM Let me start by saying that I love tacos I eat lots of tacos When I get hungry one of the first things to cross my mind is tacos That said I love El Nopalito for their tacos I m pretty picky about my tacos I don t really like dumb ass flour tortillas dry tacos unseasoned meat in a taco taco bell is not tacos the list goes on I prefer authentic Mexican street tacos That being said El Nopalito is the one place in town I feel like I am getting the most authentic street taco that I have been able to find in Phoenix The only reason I am not here more often is the commute is a bit much as I live in the East Valley However if I am anywhere near the area it is almost mandatory to stop and have at least a taco or two I recommend trying all of the tacos though my favourite has to be the cabeza it sounds creepy but is buttery and delicious It does help if you speak Spanish as it will make ordering and asking any questions you may have easier One of my favorite places to go with the kids for lunch Bring a small amount of grab yourself a table under the trees and enjoy the afternoon away while your kids play within eyesight The entire patio is really a large fenced grassy tree filled area with volleyball courts multiple gathering areas ping pong horse shoes jumbo checkers and even another fenced in area full of sand and toys for the kids Great library take your canned food to donate all during APRIL and they wave off your fines GREAT cause GREAT deal and now fine free I went in to check out the new drop of denim that the boys at The Phoenicia Association got in and left with a new pair of Naked and Famous Raw Selvedge Denim Weird Guy cut and a shirt by Wrath Arcane with the sickest little pocket that drops from your breast to your waist perfect for my lighter and cigs with a little zipper at the bottom Spent a nice chunk of dough but nothing crazy for such a nice combo I can wear to dinner with the parents or to Old Town Downtown on a Saturday night I love breweries and I love Four Peaks One of e best breweries in Az We came here on a Friday night but had no trouble getting a table This place is huge and packed but still room to move around We ordered the Hopshot IPA which is a great beer I ve been here a few time and always had a good experience I can t wait till the pumpkin porter coming Oct st Great service by Angela and their Doc First time I don t have to wear reading glasses as they switched me to a mono contact Very enjoyable experience and very quick Had a issue with a contact and they track a replacement done right away Definitely recommend I used to shop her constantly when I live right across the street and I still make the drive up there even though the prices are higher than Safeway Why The staff rocks Need a certain type of wine They know where to find it Need a spice That s covered too Every employee is courteous and most importantly SPEAKS FLUENT ENGLISH Their deli rocks my socks Always fresh and always tasty I ve purchased more than a few dinners and have never been disappointed The ready to cook stuff is delicious too In the mood for some kind of meat stuffed with a vegetable and or cheese This is the place I also loved the fresh food cooked every day right in the store From BBQ to MASSIVE Sunday omelets the choices are a plenty Again not cheap but you certainly get your money s worth Go early if you want the breakfast they run out quick And you can buy good beer by the bottle Dogfish Head rocks Great decor Great food and very good service You have to try the pork belly pastrami To die for Their version of the Manhattan was very good As for the main courses you can t go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck For dessert go with the black tan pudding Oh soooo good Highly recommend this place Ditto what Kristi M said Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this place BEAUTIFUL Phoenix doesn t get much more amazing then when you re looking down at her from Dobbins Lookout A few tips Get there before pm The park closes the entry but if you re in you can stay as long as you want Be ready for a drive up a mountain scary cliffs and tight corners Make sure you go slow watch for hikers and cyclists and overall be cautious If you re heading to the summit for the views Dobbins Lookout bring a jacket or blanket It s cold and windy when the sun goes down even in the summer There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout I always look forward to a haircut with my fave Barber David always gets me the cut I want I used to head down to a another Barber off of Central Ave but never got the haircut I wanted Now I never have to worry about that So if you re ever in need of a Barber shop cut give David or one of his gals a try Cheers One word PISTACHIO in all its glory no need to say more Excellent service I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member so I tried this place I was SO HAPPY clean pleasant warm comforting The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa The staff is friendly and efficient Lavenders day spa can learn from this place Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES I HIGHLY recommend it here Go and enjoy Quick update for Mama Java s since we had the Yelp Office Hours there last week we lucked out and were able to take over the couch chairs to the right when you walk in the door It worked out perfectly Even though I hadn t been in to MJ in a couple of months Jensy remembered that I drank a soy latte incredible I felt so special almost like a regular when I walked in and she greeted me and asked if I wanted a soy latte I did and it was just as good as last time The atmosphere provided the perfect place for the yelpers to come and go chat etc I think everyone felt comfortable and welcome Thanks again to all of you who came by to visit Looking forward to the next time Lastly MJ created a yelper special of the day the hold me closer tiny yelper which i believe was a vanilla cinnamon latte Now if that didn t make us feel special what does Where else can you get fresh lemon grass fresh pork uterus and avocado ice cream Asian markets are the bomb but Lee Lee s is the BOMB DIGGETY since they have EVERYTHING Jamaican Cuban Vietnamese Korean Indian Lebanese you name it If you love to cook and I do I really do you can seriously spend hours here ONE CAVEAT The seafood is fresher and better at Ranch on th St in Phoenix Last week they were giving a discount off of your grocery bill and a free bottle of fish sauce or soy sauce If you spent over a certain amount you got a big bag of rice Go Now And have lunch in the Vietnamese restaurant attached This is my FAVORITE place to dine out in the greater Phoenix area The food I recommend the steaks is almost as good as the view and the service is impeccable My boyfriend took me here on a date a year ago and it was definitely one of the most romantic restaurants we have found in Phoenix yet The prices are a little high per entree but it s well worth it and you won t leave disappointed If you like American or French food who doesn t and have a special occasion or just feel like doing something different I highly recommend Different Pointe of View to everyone If you ever want to instantly up your cool factor with a friend or date meet them at the Lost Leaf The mere fact that there is no external sign other than the tacky open sign indicating that it is indeed the lost leaf you would probably never have any idea that the best neighborhood bar in Phoenix is inside When i am asked to describe the lost leaf to someone who has never been before it is basically a big open house with the most well stocked beer fridge you have ever seen No cocktails or draft but for atmosphere and quality of beer selection lost leaf is by far my favorite place to meet people in dtown phoenix This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area There I wrote it and I am sticking to it First off fresh local sustainable organic are not just words on the menu and the website Now in places like San Francisco and NYC this would be nothing notable but in the desert it is truly something hard to find Aside from the practical in the land of Fox Restaurants True aside and the big box store at the strip mall there really appears to be little demand for a small local restaurant on a farm It s time to make new demands It s time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighbor but I digress We enjoyed the Farmer s Feast and it was worth every penny of the person First the house cured meats including the head cheese were amazing Second how often do you get a chef s menu where each person s plate is different Not often Ultimately we each tried different items And each item was amazing I would come back for the pasta alone let along the perfectly cooked scallops and melt in your mouth sliced fillet The service was ideal If you want to eat in minutes don t come here but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food do come here I noted to the waiter that the previous night they had sturgeon something I haven t seen on a menu since N California I commented on how unique it is etc Of course it was not available on the night I was there or was it When it came to our fish course the waiter brought out sturgeon for me The restaurant didn t have enough to have it on the menu but the waiter clearly put in a special request on my behalf and made the effort to make a diner happy Maybe if I offer to work on the farm I can eat for free Careful You ll get addicted Angel Sweet is the best gelato this side of Italy The pana cotta and zupa flavors are to die for Don t settle for just one either you can get as many flavors as will fit in your cup The management thanked me profusely for my input on Yelp and graciously invited me to return as a guest to show me the true Latilla Experience I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP review The changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were Beet salad it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad pop with flavor Foraged mushroom rissotto correctally made with a depth of flavor it was good on it s own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together The service we had was phenomenal The food at Latilla is masterfully done the surroundings are majestic and breathtaking The meal we had wasn t ordinary it was extraordinary I totally love this place It reminds me of the old school hardcore Chinese restaurant my parents used to take us when we were kids D The decor is amazing unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix The walls are a teal blue adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China golden dragons and more The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate The place looks like its from a bygone era doesn t help that its in a run down strip mall but it is clean and charming inside The service was great kind to our yo and very attentive The food was the best part I can t remember the last time I had such good Chinese food and it s priced very reasonably We got the Peking dinner for which included the fried noodles hot tea wonton soup with generous noodles meat shrimp and veggies the best I ve ever had a pupu platter with eggrolls bbq skewers house wings and those cheese puff thingies the presentation is pretty cool too Next came entree sized plates of food mongolian beef fried chicken can t remember the name and the Peking fried rice The meal concluded with incredible little desserts sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey I could have eaten of them Adding in a beverage and tax the meal was only My yo can really eat so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for people with him the of us walked out with lots of leftovers Highly recommended Do it DO IT Simply an AWESOME tuna sandwich Great service and the atmosphere was really cool Just wondering what the difference is between pickles and cucumbers in brine cents apparently After shopping all over town and visiting every single shop in the phx area I stumbled into this little gem Store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority but I am sure could be ordered if needed This planning I found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since I dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk there just isnt any here Only quality sought after items Management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated When you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly knowledgeable and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place Thanks again Reef Monsters for the help in sorting out what was an overwhelming amount of information into a custom tailoring to what I could handle and needed to continue in this hobby Being English and missing a lot of the things we can t get over here we were delighted to have found this place I have not tried all of the pasties and have stuck to the traditional ones that we get at home i e cheese and onion and cornish and they are very good I sent my husband there to buy their half baked ones so we could freeze them and have whenever we get the craving and I ended up ordering worth without any regrets Needless to say my freezer is full of pasties and I even have a couple of ones I have not tasted before so looking forward to trying those Have not eaten in the place either but quite frankly the food is that good I don t it would matter what it s like inside Also just noticed this is the Mesa shop we have only bought from the newly opened on in Tempe You like hotdogs Motor thats me says get in your Mommy s oldsmobuick and get over to TEDS AND you sissys that like sonoran style dogs talking smack about Teds go back to Tucson and eat your fru fru pineapple topped dogs with peanut butter This is old style th of July chargrilled hotdogs and hamburgers Makes my mouth water Ok so visualize and taste this in your mind First the juicy hamburgers that have the hardwood charcoal taste that makes your mouth water The crispy ice berg lettuce juicy tomato and onion make this a purist burger lover s dream Real good home made taste So now act you like you always do on the th of July and get an all beef hotdog First a warning You will crave their hotdogs after you eat em The crispy plump skin that cracks in your mouth and the taste is like when you were a kid and watching the fire works on the fourth Add the spicy brown mustard with their ketchup hot sauce and buddy you got yourself dilemma The dilemma you ask Is do you order one more hotdog cause they are soooo goood Try the Italian for a spicy dog Don t start with me on the fries and onion rings Just make sure you wear your fat pants Motor out and going back for another dog Yum yum yum Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away We didn t want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful The fig cake is delicious Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband Don t remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow We ve since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people Enjoy Yup It s all true Great food super charming place very intimate We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp Enjoyed the olives as a starter as well as some fried raviolis yes please and a caprese salad app Outstanding artisan pizza with as good a crust as I ve ever had and homemade mozzarella Wine was just ok but very reasonable Server was attentive helpful and friendly Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux cowboys arriving in limos with gallon hats Then add a point back for the near fight we got to watch between a biker and the faux cowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac We ll be back and with more friends i miss this place so much it s insanity ten high kentucky bourbon is all i can say and i never really cared how bad i felt the next day T Cook s continues to be my go to spot with or without my fiance It s like my home away from home I feel comfortable going in for a drink or a bite to eat any night of the week Let me be clear about one thing however I always sit at the bar In addition to the regular menu items the burger at T Cooks is consistently amazing This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now Anyone up for a burger I ve been going to Orange theory for awhile and I can t believe how much I ve toned up and slimmed down I haven t bulked up and now I m on my way to getting my bikini body back I highly recommend this work out It s so awesome and I can t believe I can get my full work out in an hour This place is amazing The food was delicious the waffle was like no other The service was great very attentive and nice I will be returning We make it a tradition to come here whenever family is in town So I ve probably been here atleast times Love their steak with buttered plates We ve had it before where the streak wasnt cooked to our satisfaction But after being there so many times I know how to order it Sweet potato casserole is excellent Cesar salad is the best I ve ever had On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly but I ve had it before where they are like buzzing bees I usually like to have tea after dinner which is always nice The atmosphere is good It is nicer to sit in the main dining area near the windows instead of the side room Also people if you are going to spend hundred dollars on dinner don t cheap out on a babysitter Nobody wants to listen to your whinnying little brat kids who can t sit still Ruth Chris should have an age requirement I ve been to Mortons twice Once in Chicago and once in Phoenix and both times it wasn t as good as Ruth Chris O M G So GOOD My family I keep coming back to this place We drive over miles to get our fix I think it s safe to say that we are officially hooked and when we are jonesin for Tacos Atoyac there better not be anyone or anything standing between us and our Food Today we all came aways lickin our chops and yummy in our Tummy I might not brush my teeth tonight Here s what we had I had scrambled eggs with chorizo dry cheese onions potatoes and Jalapenos Served with side of refried black beans and spicy rice and a little plate of grilled onions sweet tastey and jalapenos The little woman had a Spicy burrito al pastor cheese onions jalapenos mayo avocado The kid had mini carne asada tacos with cheese Great food and service Normally a wait on the weekend but what would you expect There are certain people in your life that you should have trust A good mechanic is high on that list I found out about Whitey s Auto through twitter Many of my friends were communicating with Scott the GM and I started following him too His tweets were funny authentic and relevant and not always about auto repair The most important aspect of his tweets They re immediate At the time I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn t need to go to Whitey s for service However when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it Scott responded for me to call him and he d help me out Although Whitey s doesn t do body work their neighbor st Class Auto Body does Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right He had made me a lifelong customer at that point When my boyfriend s truck kept leaking oil and he wasn t getting results at the shop he was taking it to I took him to Whitey s and introduced him to Scott With one check Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for Scott told him if he didn t mind the leak he could put off the service work as it wasn t something imperative And he didn t charge him for the assessment Recently the belts on my car fell off causing my a c to go out lights to come on my dash My warranty was over but I didn t even hesitate I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey s Replacement belts and labor plus they checked my battery and charged it for me cost less than it would have at the dealership The inexpensive cost along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust make Whitey s irreplaceable Don t hesitate to take your vehicle there first when you need service When we first moved to Ocotillo the first thing we did was peruse yelp for the best local eateries Mikado was one of the first things to splash onto our radar and we had to check it out Luckily for us Mikado is literally a minute drive from our house The restaurant is low key and I like how the lighting is a little dimmer than usual to create a more mellow ambience The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable So anyway on to the sushi I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because it s so ginormous They stuff large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce LOVE And while I m on the subject Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura Their tempura shrimp is super crispy isn t greasy and always fresh out of the fryer The Crunch Roll is superb the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious Their prices are great and you still get so much food How can you go wrong If you re within a mile radius of Mikado you need to stop by Also I can t say this enough Please support your local businesses They depend on your patronage I ve always been partial to Harkins Theaters because they have the best seats I used to say You know what would be the best theater AMC experience with Harkins seats Guess what AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that I love this place It s frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it Not to mention an IMAX The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable Nothing really more to say that it s a theater I do like the new Stubs card that they put out Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it but it s only a year Not bad for all the free stuff you get Another cool thing about this theater is the location If you are going to grab dinner lunch before hand ther eis a ton of places to choose from Nice work AMC on making a great theater Ohhh big big big heads up Be sure to see a movie before Noon or ya get to pay nice big money that s probably the draw back I ll still give you stars Ok technically this is not Mexican food it s spanish and puerto rican food but has a lot of the same kinds of spices and is WAY WAY WAY good first off they have plaintains which look like bananas but taste like potatoes if you ve never had them try them here yum this is definitely the place to go with a big group of peole and share a few different dishes good luck because the menu is HUGE the dessert menu alone has two dozen items seafood like ceviche and paella supposed to be to die for tapas tamales soup salads egg dishes not breakfast the list goes on and on and that s just lunch plates top off around for the most expensive for lunch but you can easily make a meal out of two apps the mojito is their specialty and they have i think a dozen rums to choose from along with sangria on the last monday of the month every bottle of spanish wine is half off you cork it if you don t finish it i can t give this rest a more glowing recommendation Durants ROCKS I love the red velvet walls I love walking through the kitchen to get to the restaurant I love the garlicky cheesy bread that probably has a million calories in it I love the steaks I love the decor I love the bar We all ordered different items when we went here for dinner one night and all raved about what we had I don t think you can go wrong no matter what you order It s amazing delicious and very very unique I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis ripped tendons in the foot I was not getting enough massage to make much progress I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing They had the right touch pressure and listened to what I needed Going back for more Recently bought a house and had issues with the speed and interference with the very many wifi networks around me I decided to go wired so after I did a lot of research on how to get a wire from my second floor to first floor for the entertainment center I bought a lot of tools from Fry s electronics and then after I started actually looking at what I had to do I realized it would not be something I can do myself I called good guys electric and they came over and ran a couple of wires using CAT instead of the CAT I would have used through the nail ridden attic and through walls without any wires sticking out while they kept away from the electrical wires to prevent interference I returned the tools and wire I got from Fry s electronics and that made the install very affordable I m very happy with the quality of my network speed now being able to stream HD content from my server upstairs to the TV feet away After completing the network wiring job I had them install a new chandelier on a remote controlled dimmer switch which was done quickly and works great Been here twice First time to fix a broken window regulator and the second time to get a checkup All the techs have been extremely honest and I ve never felt taken advantage of I spent over a grand on updates to my car there and I could ve spent more but again they re honest and didn t pressure me to do everything that they said It s family owned run they re originally from the bay area so of course I ve got a soft spot If you have car problems need a check up or need a second opinion they won t steer you wrong pun intended The food is fantastic the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix regardless of price The cheese is amazing I love their flour tortilla flautas crispy beef tacos cheese crisps enchiladas I could go on and on I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food I highly recommend El Bravo This review has been waiting and waiting for me to get it out there so here goes Baiz market reminds me of Chicago There are so many great Middle Eastern markets back there that I felt spoiled when I came to Phoenix and didn t know of many If you think of Lee Lee as the goto spot for all of your Asian cooking needs then Baiz is the place to go to for all of your Middle Eastern cooking needs And with Al Hana check out my review for that too right inside to satiate your hunger Baiz is numero uno in my book This place is fantastic the food is fantastic the prices are fantastic and being able to grab all the ingredients I need to make homemade baba ganoush while snacking on an amazing kufta sandwich is pretty okay too Stayed here one night while traveling to Phoenix for business What a cool hotel I ve never stayed anywhere like this I didn t experience the s personally but this place has really kept and captured that essence And yes it s been renovated This place was built in the s but it s not run down or anything like that The room was nice the pool looked great never got to go the service was impeccable the food at Zuzu was very good Old town Scottsdale is right around the corner with great restaurants and bars What s not to like It s called America s friendliest airport for a reason it truly embodies world class service to all I love it here it s clean great places to eat and smiling faces to great you esp at TSA short leash is awesome we tried the sample platter and they delivered it to us inside the bar we were also given an additional sample tray to try for free everything was delicious and had a very unique take on a common american snack I can t wait until they come back As a sissy vegetarian I feel compelled to mention the soup that no one has yet mentioned at Da Vang THE TAMARIND BASED SOUP HOT POT IS AMAZING I don t know if they use any other animal broth in it because I am willfully ignorant of such matters Regardless if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian try the tamarind soup and bring friends It is super yummy They also have a rice based soup And if you talk to your server they can likely recommend some vegetarian tofu based dishes that will be wonderful Everything else is as good as everyone says it is Wouldn t be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of sub par pho every family restaurant makes mistakes I d recommend everyone try it again Can t say enough about this place We were amazed by the room and it s stylings and even more amazed with the pool and the view from it We were on a mission to chill and found the perfect place Views of Camelback Mountain and a staff that knew what they were doing Try the brie quesadillas and the Sanctuary lemonade I just stopped in tonight after the gym I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than bars of soap It was late when I walked in before close This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush It was empty and the lines were short Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me The new location is big open and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mish mosh diner But that s just aesthetics I realize The food is great I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes I m not a huge fan of duck but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers mushrooms and ground pork if that helps you find it on the menu The drunken dragon is also fabulous and at for lunch and for dinner Yupha s a steal I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago Yum I think it s my favorite Thai in the greater campus area but then I thought about it and isn t most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area I think so Anyway Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they re trying hard with this grand opening A little ass kissing is nice but then again places like these are for regulars so I guess they don t have to be overly nice to me I m just here to grub EAT HERE And ask for twice the spicy you would normally The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium Unfortunately my birthday always falls right around Mother s Day Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed We thought we d celebrate early by going on Saturday but it was still packed We called ahead and the earliest reservation was PM but the person on the phone said that if we just came down they would fit us in So we sat at the bar for maybe minutes IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami These people think of everything And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive The hostess heard me say something about my birthday which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip which was soooo tasty My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it These are true professionals Asparagus was cooked perfectly The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy And the dessert Triple creme brulee kahlua which tasted like a caucasian chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human Yes it s a little pricey but you easily get meals if not more out of one dish Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded If you are wierd about personal space this is probably not the place to go Overall I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity This place is the best place I ve found so far for sushi in the Phoenix area The wait staff is always attentive the sushi isn t overpriced and their specialty sushis are actually good They stick to the basics and don t veer too much into the west for their ideas The plates and silverware are clean which is more than I was able to say at a different place I d tried The sushi prices are similar to other places I ve seen except you get pieces not They don t stick too much rice in the rolls The pieces can sometimes push the limit but most are manageable All in all this is a great place that I will come back to time and again This company is Awesome I was recommended to go here by a friend and was hesitant since it was my first time going to a salon I was extremely impressed with how welcoming they are and how dedicated they are to making your experience unforgettable They gave me a facial massage treatment thing that was out of this world The entire day I walked around with my face forward and could not stop talking about how great I felt I will be visiting quite often Thank you so much John Paul D First time here new favorite You can create your own antipasti plate and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had Service was good Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful Monkey bread is also stellar I cannot wait to go back This little spot in the art district of Scottsdale is as good a lunch restaurant as I ve been to I had the mahi mahi tacos and was blown away by the attention to detail in the flavors bringing the dish together as well as the wonderfully tasteful presentation Of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses about which I don t have sufficient words to do justice Both my father and I were hard pressed not to buy a condo in Scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view They were dressed tastefully not in the slightest bit slutty but holy god I have totally fallen in love at Tuck Shop Everything here is fantastic My friend and I come here about twice a month and enjoy some snacks and wine The beer battered Cheese Curds may just change your life for the better we are seriously tempted to each get our own order I am not very good at sharing and i always get what I want No i m not an only child well maybe I was until i was how did you know WAH Oh and Laura is fantastic She always takes great care of us as we enjoy a glass of wine on the couch in the reading room Thursday s special is meat loaf don t deny yourself just indulge I m on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a community wide service day We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd Kathy the head of volunteer services met with us and gave us a thorough introduction She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take in and shelter animals She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics Did you know that over years un neutered cats can breed to reach in numbers and dogs thats CRAZY and so compelling Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities we saw dogs horses cats and bunnies It was very eye opening First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter The animal accommodations are so impressive The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasn t as heartbroken as I thought I d be bc they really had nice size spaces There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park There are also private puppy rooms The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w o any odors The volunteers were so nice kind and devoted to the animals We got to feed horses play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the hours we were there It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them Best Greek food I had in Arizona and excellent entertainment The dolma s were the best I ve had their version of Babaganoush was very good and they had many lamb based dishes The entertainment was great Live music belly dancing greek style fun broken plates and dancing Since I had the sampler plate I can tell you that if you re vegan vegetarian or any other wacko thing like that you might not enjoy the food here Greek Lasagna really Also the chicken was no good but I don t really like chicken anyway Clean organized and well stocked for the most part Fujiya s carries my favorite car freshener chips bread and iced coffee in a can among many other good things Reasonably priced and extremely courteous customer service I am always happy to shop there The bentos I wish are kept in warmers like Suruki in San Mateo CA but Fujiya has an area adjacent to the register which includes a microwave to heat your purchased bento so you can sit and eat and relax after shopping What I love so much about their service is that I can place my order ahead of time and they ll have it available and ready I think this is the only Japanese store that has just about everything I need to stock my pantry It s no wonder I ve been coming here year after year Too long it took me way too long to make it to Sens Sens is what we need more of in Phoenix Seated promptly on a Friday night by Johnny Chu himself Johnny Chu really has put together a winner here Johnny Chu alright I admit it I like saying his name The Asian tapas idea is new to me having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas but alas never an Asian tapas joint I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria The Tofu dishes are amazing How do you learn to love Okra Get it at Sens The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts One taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor fantastic I will be back to Sens Tapas Sake Bar soon do you think you could invent an Asian Sangria C mon Johnny I know you can do it The best burgers in Phoenix The owners are great and am on a first name basis Forget about fast food and support this local business Go double Add bacon Park at Circle K if in a hurry Plan on holding it until you get home Stick to the burger and fries genius So for my date tonight to the Compass Room I needed to get my nails done I removed my acrylics myself last week I read the reviews here and decided to try DV You know sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time it s almost like the Soup Nazi Not this place There were two girls ahead of me so I waited a bit but only about ten minutes It s bigger than the place I had been going to Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs That was nice Yeah there were still speaking Vietnamese or so I think to each other yes probably about us gringas but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations I had Le She was so sweet I told her all about my date too She was quick and made some suggestions about what to get Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint I was kinda short on time so I went with her suggestion of white tips Plus it was about cheaper She was quick but really methodical I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I ve gotten out here in the PHX She even called me by name throughout the conversation for a new full set Not bad at all My wife s work had their Christmas party here last night Although the customer service was slow and average at best the food was outstanding I had a burger and my wife the steak salad I was the DD but my wife said the margaritas were excellent Dessert was tiramisu and sweet potato cheesecake Great little place with a nice vibrant ambiance I used Harvil s Auto Body after a fender bender They were one of the auto body places that was included in State Farm s program They were efficient friendly proactive highly responsive and helpful I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for me my vehicle when needed This level of high quality customer services is hard to come by If you have a choice choose Harvil s You won t be disappointed Came for the beer stayed for the scenery LOVED THE SWITCH WITH JENNIFER ANISTON what is wrong with film critics today FEZ should stand for Fabulous Exotic ZExperience I was planning on making it here for ages but couldnt until I found out the new metro rail is ride outside I needed a quiet place to read and was much obliged when they turned off all music by my request I was able to read my Nancy Bartholomew novles with great intensity The staff left me alone for hours and the intoxicating rosemary smell really opened my buds The atmosphere is definatly trendy After I finnaly soaked it all in I would def give this place stars although I didnt try the food or bar Get ready to get meat drunk then fall into a meat coma Although this is not a nationwide chain this is what a chain restaurant can and should be it s great You begin with an immaculate salad bar Definitely the best one I have ever seen or tasted for that matter Hell you have to love a salad bar that has a whole wheel of Parmesan cheese for you to enjoy Enough with the salad lets talk about the star of the show the meat Transcendental might be too strong of a word but it is pretty damn close It is endless amounts of meat prepared different ways all seasoned perfectly You have to love something that is seasoned so well that if adding salt or pepper to it at the table would over season it This place is pretty much a buffet that comes to you and after trying several meats its great because you don t want to move lol And the best part is is that you tell them when to come to you I could go on and on but if you have about bucks to spend and want to enjoy a great meal just go here and leave in physical pain from over eating like I do WOW what can I say our friends have eaten here for years and we finally got to eat at Don and Charlie s for the first time in all the years that we have been coming to Spring Training We had an excellent dinner i was in the mood for fish and had the Macademia crusted Halibut WONDERFUL My hubby had the prime rib and finished off every last juicy bite the scalloped potatoes were the BEST I have ever had at any restaurant Must make this one of our usual stops during our yearly visit to Az I m a girl who knows her way around a donut The boyfriend and I would usually venture out to Chandler to get our Bosa Donut fix so I was super excited to discover they had opened a location closer to home I was also super scared for my waistband Bosa is hands down the best donut shop in the Valley Not that there is a ton of competition but still They re really good They offer a wide variety from your classic cake to puffy glazed filled to fritters My favorite is the glazed twist So chock full of sugary sweetness my teeth kinda hurt just thinking about it Their donuts are always fresh and they keep a good stock available so you re not stuck with only the coconut donuts I brought in a bunch to work the other day and my co workers gobbled them up Who doesn t love being handed a frosted piece of donut heaven I m sure I will become a regular of the Tempe Bosa in no time This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it Good flavor lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup which is pretty freakin great There s alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware Cute busy place in Central Phoenix Not hiding behind gimmicks to make themselves authentic Simple and sweet Staff is well versed in Japanese food if you haven t had it in years ask Great staff great food great times Wait a second I have not written a review This is nuts Anyways I adore this place LGO and the pizzeria are my favorite places in the world lol I am here at least times per week It is nuts Anyways the reason I am here all the time is because it is FABULOUS This place can never go wrong The orange and fennel salad it amazing It is the perfect mix and each bite and a delight in your mouth and to your taste buds I often get this salad through out the week I love the kale and quinoa salad too It is my go to salad I am obsessed with the avocado pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese and the roasted corn pizza with prosciutto I wish I could get enough but I cannot The ambiance is awesome Mr Lynn is a genius and made this place so welcoming and open I love how its so laid back and romantic at the same time The parking is difficult but you expect that since it is so popular Now the Peanut Butter Pie OMG OMG OMG There are no words it is DELICIOUS I try to refuse every time but I cannot I really enjoy the sangria The wine selection is great I just love this place The place to go during spring training after a game and see a baseball player will be crowded for sure the experience is just really neat though the place is covered head to toe with sports memorabilia definitely the place to go if you re a visiting sports fan in scottsdale Just had my first hot dog at Short Leash Dogs and quite honestly I can t call it a hot dog because that just conjures up images of well a hot dog And Short Leash Dogs are so much more and better than a hot dog the way most people know hot dogs Know what I mean No Well go have a Short Leash Dog Really unique combinations various dog options all local meats and produce bratwurst beer hot veggie My friend and I shared an Aiko we chose the brat as our dog with mango chutney red onions cilantro mayo and jalape o on a naan you might have read that in other reviews no traditional buns here You can find the Short Leash Dogs truck at the Phoenix Public Market on Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings and if you follow them on Twitter shortleashdogs you can find out when where else they make regular stops scottsdale central phoenix Track em down and eat their food And talk to them Brad and Kat are smart enthusiastic folks with a great sense of humor and offer superb food and service What s not to love Really good food fun atmosphere great experience and totally unique and fun I would way rather spend my money at a one of a kind family owned shop than a cheaper dime a dozen corporate mcdonalds OK I went based on Tim C s Yelp review of this place and I am so glad I did I rode my bike up there around PM Wednesday afternoon and I have to say I was not disappointed Even though it was hot out the outdoor table was surprisingly cool and comfortable I got an iced soy latte and it was so good I don t know how to explain it but there is great tasting espresso and there is bland espresso This place just has great tasting espresso I found out while I was there that Ted the guy who made it had roasted the beans himself You can buy the beans from them if you are one of those industrious people who grind and brew your own espresso drinks I am not I prefer to leave that to the professionals He actually ground the espresso when I ordered my drink If you get the chance please go see what I am talking about You will notice how much better the espresso is The place itself is so beautiful and relaxing If you sit outside like I did you are basically sitting in a big outdoor garden It is kept cool by the overhead canopy and the swamp cooler air blowing out from inside the coffee shop Ted was really friendly I felt comfortable just hanging out for a while reading my book Unfortunately the coffee shop closes at PM otherwise I bet it would be beautiful at night This place definitely looks like something that would be in a cool little town somewhere and not off of a busy street like Hayden Rd Ted also told me he makes the lemonade himself fresh squeezed something I love and will definitely try When I go back I think I will go a bit earlier I may do a bit of plant shopping as well while I am there Bottom line Great atmosphere drinks and service If there was a Cantina Laredo in my home Los Angeles I would dine here regularly despite the multitude and variety of Mexican dining options Needless to say when I m in Scottsdale I often find myself drawn to Cantina Laredo From the moment you re in to the moment you re out Cantina Laredo takes excellent care of your tastebuds The chips are salsa aren t filler but a real treat Their homemade salsas are worthy of bringing in your own jars to export back home some of my favorite salsa anywhere I believe they have three different kinds Their tequila options are wonderful allowing for creative margaritas or a fine neat glass of pure agave goodness I promise to never use that phrase again sorry Readers The entrees aren t just your common taco burrito fare Using juicy meats creative homemade sauces and interesting pairings Cantina Laredo professes its love for Mexican food and culture reminding diners how lovable these things are The decor and various areas are all quite nice as well An excellent complement to what always proves to be an excellent meal C Of the sites this is the Kindergarten My daughter is attending here and I simply love it She s five and is repeating kindergarten She attended kindergarten last year early at the encouragement of her preschool teachers who thought she was bored in their classes We are having her repeat because she s a little young for first grade but this isn t an issue because the curriculum rolls every two years for that very reason In her first year she learned to read write do simple math know all her sign language letters and has more Spanish knowledge than I do this year they will build upon all of that and take her further The staff is great and care a lot about the kids And when issues arise they work with the parents to get them solved both at school and at home It s pricey But so very worth it Best chocolate ever I tried Leonidas for the first time in Europe and have been looking for it ever since in AZ I m so surprised they opened a store here would recommend it in a heartbeat Also staff was very friendly a great place to get gifts I just got an assortment of chocolates and was very happy with my choices The banana creme was surprisingly good and so was the champagne flavored Consistent offerings of service food atmosphere and drinks is what makes this franchise successful No matter whether I ve been to Fogo in DC Baltimore or here in Scottsdale I get the same gut busting food and well made drinks in a place where I could either wear a suit and tie or jeans and a t shirt A specific note on this particular location there were a lot of families with small children on this particular Friday night No judging but I ve never seen that at any other Fogo Fogo back east is really date night or the kind of place to pre game for a bachelor party or a business dinner but not to bring infants and toddlers Possibly a by product of its location on Scottsdale Road in a strip mall near a few hotels IMHO this is not the place to bring kids but I respect the rights of anyone to do so If I was traveling w kids in tow and I didn t have a Fogo in my city it d be hard to pass up In any regard it did not bother me in the least I was too wrapped up in my company and the food and those drinks You will easily spend over per person here including tip so prepare to camp out eat slowly enjoy your meal and be treated like royalty The house special sirloin will make you rethink how to prepare sirloin at home it s that good Don t fill up on salad at the salad bar you can do that at Olive Garden but do enjoy the cheeses mushrooms vegetables and cold cuts which raise the salad bar Did you see what I just did there Nice wine selections here Ask for a Brazilian red to enjoy with your meal if you have the coin My dear love and I went to the museum on a romantic date and had such a lovely time I hadnt been to the museum in years and it was a lot of fun to see some paintings I remembered from my childhood like the Frida Kahlo They firefly room is utterly transporting as well Frankly I dont know if it was the art or my dear love that made the evening so wonderful but we will go again soon I strongly recommend a strolling date here Wednesdays and maybe one other night are free Oh and here s a tip if you cant find a space park across the street at the Viad Tower Its free if you exit from the north side This is a great dog park Plenty of grass to run around on and there is always a good crowd to play with And drinking fountains and places to sit The majority of the dogs are nice but there are a few Scottsdale poodles who think they are the shit and their owners just ignore their bad behavior I just stick my gum in their curly hair and go on with my day The best part of the park is when I get home and the dog takes a nice long nap and I can do chores in peace Falafel is outstanding here dark exterior with green interior and a nice spicy peppery taste that is satisfying Cooked just right too for texture Fries are a nice side Prices reasonable here plenty of parking and a few atypical sodas available in the fridge Note that there s just a few seats inside since this is also a grocery place To go will probably be my main strategy for this great Falafel destination Whenever I start leaning toward being a vegetarian like my daughter is I remember the smell and taste of that scrumptious melt in your mouth filet mignon at Durant s And the hot fudge sundae for dessert Dang just can t beat it The bartenders are old school not too aloof not fawning just professional and classy The best I came here on the opening night when someone from Gin Blossoms played on a makeshift stage the beers were cents and there was no food but you know me we ordered a pizza from a neighborhood pizza place Since then they have added a full kitchen and the food is amazing chicken strips that were designed for diners who appreciate tempura like batter and are over the age of four the beer is astounding one word Kolsch makes me swoon and the people are great It s worth the walk wherever you end up finding a space to park even better ride your bike over like we do The Sunday brunch is great All of my friends sit and wish they had a student loan that would enable them to spend at least half of the day drinking here daily I don t blame them i absolutely LOVE maxim and i have eaten there approximately times a week since i learned about the restaurant a year ago the atmosphere is pretty awful but the food is amazing i get a which is a noodle tofu and vegetable soup the broth is meat based it is comforting and cheap and always improves a bad day everyone i have taken there has enjoyed the food as well though they tend to enjoy the vietnamese dishes more than the chinese ones highly highly recommended Now open on Saturdays Yes Special Not on menu Chicken strawberry raspberry blackberry blueberry goat cheese salad with raspberry vinagerette This was THE best salad I ve ever had and probably top best meals in my life So I have to admit that I once threw up in the Pita Jungle bathroom but it was not Pita Jungle s fault it was definitely something I ate the night before It certainly made for a memorable first date experience with my now husband and we have been back many many times Oh how I love Pita Jungle I haven t tried anything that I wouldn t have again in a heartbeat currently I am hooked on the Potato Pizza yummy Their breakfast options are wonderful definitely try it on a lazy Sunday morning There is usually no wait The ambiance is fantastic casual and arty with a little bit of crunchy granola thrown in A for vegetarians and meat eaters alike Eat hummus and pita Try falafel Try anything on the menu because it is all good Love the atmosphere the patios drinks and especially the chicken lollipops If you haven t tried them they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record books I am also a fan that they serve breakfast days a week and have free wifi This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game Not too stuffy but nice enough that it isn t just labeled a bar So yummy I got the low calorie yogurt with all kinds of yummy fruit in it didn t even feel guilty Such a fun place to go with friends or as a nice dessert after dinner I can t wait to go again I heart Sky Harbor Airport Parking Of course it s always nice to find a ride to or from the airport but when you re all out of favors and you have only yourself to rely on it comes down to driving yourself or getting a taxi Sky Harbor Parking to the rescue For a day or cheaper if you print the coupons from their website the folks at Sky Harbor Parking make it easy to drop your car and get to your gate in no time and I ve used them a handful of times solo and with the BF so I know it s door to door consistent service If you are interested in covered parking call ahead but otherwise just drive over to Washington and th and they will take care of you from there Also I recommend calling from the airport once you have your bags and they are always good about picking you up within minutes to take you back to your car I hope you ll find Sky Harbor Airport Parking as useful and convenient as I do safe travels we rode our bikes here today in search of a new place to try the online menu looked like it had a few options for non meat eaters although it is very much a meat heavy menu for an easter sunday lunch it was very empty not a good sign but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing the decor is country but not like cracker barrel more like neo farm dining i had the blackened fish sandwich which was cooked really well nice and seared but juicy topped with onion pickles tomatoes and butter lettuce i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heat nothing to burn your mouth my wife had the tuna sandwich which was also tasty and seared just right she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable but it was her dish not mine her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful i would love to come back here and hope they are able to make it here well worth the bike ride I can t really say enough about Liberty Market The place is beautiful comfortable friendly and the service is awesome I haven t had anything that I didn t like From the wood fired pizza to the delectable salads everything on the menu is worth every penny For me though it s all about the Cortadito espresso drink and the pastries These are completely off the chart awesome You simply MUST try them Another great plus to this place is that on just about any given day you can visit and see Joe the owner hanging out chatting with customers and all around having a great time Joe is truly one of the nicest and most sincere people I have ever met Makes Liberty Market all the more worth visiting Oh As weird as it sounds you have to check out the bathrooms they are the best I have ever seen seriously This place was the answer to my German grocery shopping dreams I thank the Yelp community for leading me to Old Heidelberg I was picking up a number of items for an Oktoberfest party I was cooking for and hosting at my house and was able to fulfill most of my exotic German needs at this one stop I picked up pumpernickel rye bread authentic concentrated Maggi W rze seasoning not the soy sauce tasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores and Knorr zwiebel kr uter salat kr nung They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just can t find over here for instance sauerbraten gravy I stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place Andrea and Chris I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years including Berlin and Bavaria They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections I promised I would be back especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberkn del liver dumplings I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook line and sinker as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies It doesn t matter which location you go to it s all the same and GREAT If you like P F Changs you will love Pei Wei It s essentially the same thing in a less formal dining setting Take Out I can t tell a difference between their Orange Chicken or the lettuce wraps minus the price tag My favorite dish here is the Dan Dan Noodles It s Hot Spicy Pure Indulgence Pleasure for under If you have not heard Pei Wei is not authentic Asian food Well neither is Panda Express but I ll tell you Pei Wei is better than Panda Express most Authentic Asian restaurants in the US Yes I said most Authentic Asian restaurants NO MSG Can you believe the balls on this guy We ll I have had Chinese food in China Towns in San Francisco LA NY Vancouver Dallas I ve even had Peking Duck in Hong Kong don t be impressed it was not that good I love Chinese food but I really love Asian Fusion Roy s PF Changs Pei Wei really wet my noodle The other nice thing about Pei Wei is their take out I have them on speed dial So when I m on my way home from work I ll call as I pull in I pay pick up and go It s freshly cooked No Wait Really Because it doesn t get any better than this For what it is and for what it s worth this place is truly unique A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place this quaint spot serves up good tasty and satisfying food hot from the kitchen What is a pasty A pasty s history can be associated with the tin miners in England The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface Supposedly the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the handles and when done discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines At the Cornish Pasty Co I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto Very good flavoring and filling Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef potatoes and swede The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well Pros Good food Originality Portions Customer service Coat hooks at the bar Cons Small interior Half the fun is the wait If you are going to go you may as well get into it We get into it at their Italian place next door and drink tons of wine L and I later that night had a hot kiss and she lost her precious earrings I even drove back the next day to look for them somewhere against the wall Just kissing but hot if you lose earrings We went twice once alone and the nd time with her sons and friends We ordered every pizza imaginable It seems almost every high end pizza now is brick oven and more about the crust I like everyone else will mention I am from the East Coast and know pizza Best in the United States we have several that are at that level You can flip a coin on which one is better When I was recovering from surgery I received of one of their arrangements It was marvelous The quality was unbeatable with gorgeous blooms and fantastic presentation They lasted for weeks I am really pleased with this company and wouldn t hesitate to use them again Owner Daniel M is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find Daniel is from South America but you wouldn t know it his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy Daniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget OK it s not Etienne s Different Point of View s list of but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one If you re not sure just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind likely he has with a wink a special bottle in the back When we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling of cheese and wine Talk about knowing people One afternoon while drinking our th bottle of wine who walks by but Jan D Atri Wow That s another review And speaking of reviewers I also ran into Phoenix Magazine s Nikki Buchanan also extremely nice When Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress name who made a comeback some years later For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors LOL Again after much hoopla he made it Daniel s The current wood paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London Very posh yet understated Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurant s three small dining rooms The menu is a very difficult one I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection Great for steak ravioli the best carpaccio in the city best buffala mozzarella mmm I could go on and on So does the menu page after page Some might call the preparations simplistic This is the Tuscan way Simple ingredients and simple preparation Let the ingredients make their own magic Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smucker s lime jelly but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon Unfortunately the artful one of a kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away UGH they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all Daniel himself is a wonderful host He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix Most of it is just American Italian Daniel s is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant Enjoy P S post edit OMG How could I forget the Tiramisu It s a generous portion so you can share with your guest but after your first bite you may not want to Light and airy yet fantastically flavorful the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again I m not going to tell you the secret ingredient You ll have to ask Daniel I was initially going to give Riva s stars as they re really just like any other Filiberto s Umberto s Roberto s Ernie and Berto s out there except for a couple of small differences For one everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there It s probably not but it tastes like it And secondly their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there a must for any burrito The California Burrito with carne asada potatoes pico de gallo and cheese is a must as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries sour cream cheese and guacamole for only Can t be beat especially if you re hammered and it s A M Not a classy joint not a place you go if you re wary of stupid crap like health code violations the best places never are but definitely a late night hot spot for the Mill crowd Lovely And it s not for sissies that don t like ham in their beans either damnit I gave this stars based on the best Mexican food I ve had in AZ not based on white linen and waiter service just an fyi I won t write too much as it seems that everyone already has Both locations are GREAT Some of the best homestyle Mexican I ve ever had I usually get the double wrapped enchilada combo that is pure saucy heaven A great place to call ahead on a friday night when you re exhausted from work and not doing jack pick up your food pick up a six pack of Pacifico and head on home Happiness is a sure bet Pure Bliss I haven t had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time The full course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent You MUST try the Yin Yang Martini It was a very creative and well presented drink that had me all smiles I had the Smores Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite I ve tried at least others The first couple of times I ate here I wasn t sure why people were always so crazy for this place It s been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I ve already been here like three times and wanted to go back more I ve decided that it s all about what you order for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings have fun Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try Also don t be afraid to speak up I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn t pay attention Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they re happy to make it the way I like They make their breads fresh and they have garlic herb bread that has lots of flavor I won t order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing I am a picky ranch eater I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn t taste or resemble mayo I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor They have the best home made ranch dressing here Pair it with the garlic herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor OMG Wipe sorry I just started to drool a bit Service is good everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich I get the Pinner but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I m going to order the Blunt maybe someday soon All sandwiches get toasted Okay so toppings Guacamole sprouts lettuce spring mix onions mushrooms tomatoes black olives I get mine w o cucumbers pickles your choice of cheese I get Swiss with their house goodies EVOO vinegar herb mixture on top Now that I found my sandwich I crave it all the time and can t wait for my next visit Oh be sure to check their daily specials too If you re lucky enough to be in their delivery area well darn you then Went here for the first time today Loved it Becca was fun professional and did a great job I have been looking for a place to get a big boy haircut since I moved in the area a few months ago so far Canyon Falls has impressed me Normally I just settle for whats cheap and quick from an haircut place Yes I paid more for my cut at Canyon Falls but it was worth it The place is clean the employees are clean I was greeted right away when I came in and I left FEELING like I got a good cut I was only in for a cut shampoo so I cant comment on any of the other services they offer but I think I might have found a my new place to get my hair cut at last Thanks Becca Loved it Pulled pork pulled chicken bbq sauce the cole slaw were ALL outstanding ONLY caveat is that GPS tries to send you to thhe wrong side of the highway It is in the shopping center with CVS Circle K Great new addition to the Old Town neighborhood Citizen is versatile the perfect place for a romantic date a small gathering or for just meeting a buddy for a drink A place with a great vibe My first impression was that they are intently focused on service quality Lots of smiling staff to greet you as you enter Every employee is attentive to every table Our server was gregarious accommodating gracious and highly proactive We definitely felt the warm and fuzzy atmosphere They pay attention to the little things such as house made ketchup for your french fries The food about as good as upscale bar food is going to get For apps we started with the calamari and the crabcakes Portions weren t large but very high quality The calamari was flash fried and not greasy and seemed very fresh For my entree I had the wagyu burger which was prepared perfectly and served on a fresh challah bun Overall impression Citizen will have staying power unlike many establishments that open in Old Town The formula is really pretty simple offer high quality stuff equip the place with great staff and don t go overboard with prices I m looking forward to returning I had lunch here today with co workers and it was absolutely delicious Cannot wait to go back gain Perfect hotel for my conference travel needs Clean new great bars close to other food options across the street super friendly staff Great business traveler property The bed was SOOO comfortable Sometimes Starwood beds can be too soft but this was just right Access to the convention center is so convenient Just out the door and down a block and a half Can t beat that in the heat Agree with the previous review Something nice about this super target Leaving a review to back up the other My only gripe is I spend to much at Targer Or my wife does anyway Fantastic venue Province really adds a touch of class and elegance in a way that isn t pushy or over the top Located in the Westin Hotel the restaurant feels very modern You can choose to sit inside in a beautifully decorated and spacious dining area or enjoy their fabulous patio with fireplaces and a great water feature The food was unbelievable I sampled their tuna and watermelon appetizer and fell in love what an amazing combination that I d never have thought of If the food isn t enough the service is superb Every interaction with the staff was excellent you can tell they enjoy their restaurant and are happy to be there I cannot wait to come back to Province as soon as possible love love love this place for a second i don t feel like i m in fakville anymore Live music and a diverse crowd They make a great infused berry tea smoothie no dairy just juice and ice Parking is great and the selection of food is appropriate and divine for a cafe Very comfortable and not to image conscious inside Love that it s independent and staff is so lovely I would pay for a latte just to support them Punch card too I had been wanting to come back for a while I love this restaurant Last night we had a magnificent meal I started with the St Francis Lemonade a perfect cocktail to start your meal There are so many wonderful choices They are featuring a special menu for New Years however you can order from it a la carte so we decided to start with the Arizona Citrus Salad It was delicious I love the combination of dates goat cheese and orange slices I also chose from the special menu the sea scallops WOW they were so sweet and tender They were served over a bed of black lentils so amazing The portion was generous scallops I am glad I didn t order the side of sweet corn polenta I ended up ordering dessert yes my hubby twisted my arm NOT I had the usual Sticky Toffee Pudding and my hubby had the Chocolate Stout Cake I had a bite of his and it was great I cannot guarantee I won t stick to my usual dessert but it was a closed one I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live It is such a great place Looking a cutting edge wanting the best for everyone type of pet boutique you must go to Oliver and Annie s Chris the owner is amazing He knows his stuff and has the best of the best There is no pet boutique like his Urban chic and healthy top draw He is an amazing supporter of local artists and designers and an absolute delight to know and do business with His loving nature is endearing It s no surprise he just received the Best of Phoenix award Now that I have tried all the main bubble tea boba places in the Valley I can say that this place is the best and most consistent It therefore deserves five stars This is a true gem I took my dog there after bouncing around trying to find the right groomer for him I read the reviews and gave this place a try I was really happy with the customer service the service performed on my dog the fact I got a same day appt and most importantly my dog did not seem to be anxious or uncomfortable He normally leaves a groomer stressed and not himself but he seemed to be at complete ease here Umm is it possible to give MORE than stars My girlfriend believes Duane is AMAZING and hands DOWN the best handyman ever We stumbled upon him and had him come to the house to fix a ceiling fan that had fallen out of the ceiling completely Yikes His charge was reasonable for coming by about ish and he really goes above and beyond especially with quality and letting you know the facts This was a house full of girls and often times when they are clueless they try to pull a fast one NOPE not Duane He is honest and very caring When he was leaving he noticed the door had a stick to it and brought back something from his vehicle and fixed it for free Most recently my girlfriend called him at nearly pm to tell him her disposal stopped working He immediately remembered her as the house with the three dental students and exactly where she lived even though he had last been there a year ago and walked her through how to fix it over the phone for free This guy really is the epitome of what everyone wants and needs in a handyman Call him for ANY home issue you may need help with I have stopped into Copper Star on previous occasions during street festivals but today was the first time I came to sit and study Man am I a fan of this place I am lucky that I live in a location where I have a multitude of options Lux Lola Hob Nobs SBUX etc but I have to say I really liked the vibe here The music wasn t loud the people relatively quiet and chill and I could actually focus on what I was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me I liked that while on a busy street th Ave the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on That added to the peace and quiet of it Employees were nice free wi fi internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop and I enjoyed my small mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie both just under I was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie which was soooo good if I might say They are open until pm on Sundays which is pretty cool I have yet to use their drive through for coffee but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to SBUX There is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off you can give your dog a bath at Wag n Wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee Had to update because we ve now tried the pizza For all the times we have visited we ve never tried a pizza too many other really good options to choose I guess We ordered the Italian Classic veggies meat We ordered it a little well done crispy and were not disappointed It was hot fresh and cooked perfectly Service was great as usual even though they were completely SLAMMED with customers the day before Thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans potatoes two eggs and fresh warm tortillas It was fantastic This dish just like many others possibly ALL others is plenty for to share Service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and AZ won so there were a lot of happy customers that day are you joking Where else can you get the best salami ham any cold cuts anywhere I just moved here months ago and have been searching for a place like this Their meats are fantastic I discovered this place after driving by it so many times thought I d take a chance Location is awful but worth the trip Wait we re in Arizona No seriously this is Arizona I had to keep blinking cause I could ve sworn we were still in the East Bay last Friday night as we waited for our faux meat meals to arrive at our table My hubster and I were visiting his mom for the first time since she had moved to Phoenix and admittedly neither of us were too stoked on the visit We totally wanted to see her but as for Phoenix Anyways she knew what she was doing by taking us straight from the airport to Green I LOVED EVERYTHING From our appetizers hummus fries to my entree I had the chicken curry noodle bowl to my beverage a suicide mixture of their house green tea and house limeade YUM to my soy ice cream treat I had the mint with paul newman oreos which I scarfed down after being totally stuffed This place is ridiculously good And reasonably priced And fresh And not stuffy or pretentious in anyway Basically this would be our new steady if we lived anywhere near Tempe Which fortunately we do not but I have to say you Arizonians sure are stoked to have a place like Green And now we have a reason to look forward to returning to AZ D Ruth s Chris the only steak house I can fully endorse degree plates make the sizzle a memorable experience The Ahi tuna appetizer is also a must have to start the meal off right While every salad they have is a can t miss I ll go there just to get the Chop Salad Quite possibly the best place to eat in Mesa Let me tell you what you are in for if you go The CPC has taken these pilgrim pockets to the next level Personally I would recommend The Royale With Cheese or the Shepard s Pie The pies take a while to make so now would be a good time to order drinks as well If you are the beer drinking type I would suggest the Hoegaarden it s the best I ve ever had If you are looking for something more stimulating you may want to try their Irish Car Bombs Or if you are you are up to it go with both When your pasty arrives don t touch the plate It could be scorching bloody hot Your pasty is probably going to take a few minutes to become edible as well just stay clam it will cool soon enough When you have finished eating get the apple stuffed pasty for desert By now you will feel very full I know I do it every time and the only thing I can say is that it was worth it Cheers TIP to Mesa Gateway fliers This is the ONLY bar at the airport so live it love it Food is great The burgers can be made low carb especially great this gurl TIP Food can be ordered to go A great little spot to find Fresh Fresh Fresh Sushi and great eats Be sure to try the green bean appetizer This is place IS Beer Heaven Over taps of amazing beers This is the ONLY place I will purchase several beers at full price not on happy hour Amazing thing for the girls they have a shorty glass which is a oz glass instead of oz it is a beautiful thing Now I can order two different kinds of beer without getting overly full er bloated instead of the two big oz glasses Amazing thing The food is delish My boyfriend and I split a burger Bad idea It was so good we really didnt want to share it afterall Amazing thing The staff are awesome There are several staff behind the bar and ALL are happy and willing to help you if your initial server is MIA They are very attentive friendly and helpful if you can t decide Amazing thing The atmosphere is awesome and the music they play is great Some of the best pizza I ve had in Phoenix I prefer to get takeout since the inside is a little eh but who cares if the food s good I love the crust crispy and slightly chewy The pizza can be a little greasy sometimes but hey it s pizza but as long as it doesn t soak through and make the crust all flimsy which has never happened with the pizzas I get here it s nothing that a paper towel or two can t fix I m not a big wing person but my dad has had them and he says they re pretty good The staff has always been super friendly and they actually remember me even though I only come in once every couple months All I have to say is WOW This place is EXCELLENT All the dishes we had were extremely fresh authentic and DELICIOUS My favorite pot stickers EVER The skin is super thin tender not greasy mostly steamed encased around a very light delicate dumpling that makes me want to order next time is just not enough they are tiny but oh so delectable The sauce is perfectly balanced of sweet spicy and tangy and does not overpower the pot sticker It also comes with a thin airy crispy rice chip underneath the pot stickers that give it an extra texture with scallions scattered about MMMMMMmmmmm The green curry is more brothy than others than other s that I have had but no matter It is delicious with bits of vegetable and whatever meat you prefer we got chicken I love sopping it up with rice and trying to eat it with chopsticks You may need a spoon The eggplant and chicken stir fry is also fabulous The asian eggplants are cooked to perfection Their sauces are spot on BEST Coconut ice cream It is light fluffy icy dreamy pea nutty coconut cloud confection that makes my mouth water It is not sickly sweet sticky artificial coconut tasting at all Predominant coconut flavor is not my favorite and I LOVE THIS Even if you don t like curries there is plenty of food here that will make you a fan This is a mom and pop kind of place they are really nice It s a trek for us but definitely worth the drive Stayed at the hotel from till Excellent hotel and the stuff was great Originally was supposed to come during Hurricane Sandy and couldn t fly out as I was affected by the storm The hotel staff had no problem changing my reservation and didn t even change the price Everything was great The room was clean The pool was excellent Hands down the best spa I have visited in the state and perhaps the nation Massages were amazing Drinks and brunch were amazing Staff went out of their way to take care of our every need Went at am to relax for the day and stayed until pm which is unheard of for me at a spa once the initial massage has taken place but this place kept me going all afternoon with the plunge pool sauna and steam Also the pool and spa hot tube outside were amazing I honestly cannot say enough about AJi and its wonderful staff I will return I really REALLY like The Lodge so I was gonna give it stars To be honest though I really can t think of any good reason NOT to give it that th star I ve mostly been here for Happy Hour when visiting AZ but I ve also stopped in a few late nights and have always had a good time The Lodge has one of the best Happy Hours deal wise in Old Town All apps except the mac cheese and fried pickles are half off along w cheap drafts Lodge signature drafts which is a tasty beer wells stuck to beer on this last trip but if I recall in the past they actually use a heavy pour during happy hour I ve tried quite a few of the apps and they re all good The pretzels cheese are particularly tasty I always get pretzels cheese no matter where I am w the friend I came here w for happy hour the last time I was here so I can say I ve tried quite a few in my day the Lodge s ranks right up there I admit I m a sucker for cheesy theme bars so I kind of of dig the ski lodge theme here the dining room area isn t huge but is clean w comfy seats The bar area is pretty big the patio is nice weather permitting I ve never had an issue w the service here both bartenders bouncers are always nice Mmm Delicious Indian food and a great selection of vegetarian dishes I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose I m a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didn t have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy I had a bowl of brown rice cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt cucumber mint sauce on the side It was fantastic I can t wait to go back also I thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for making the drive to their location and to compensate for high gas prices A memorable gesture Many have started out with this and it should be stressed this wonderful place is TINY Suggest you make a reservation so you get he chance to enjoy the wonderful food that is in store We started with the stuffed mushrooms like many others raved about and the Portuguese style mussels Both were fantastic and left us wanting to come back to try the other mussel offerings and appys as well The endless bread was the perfect tool for soaking up the rich juices the mussels were bathed in We re we re pretty full but thought we would take a run at the Espana pizza Hands down the best pizza we have ever had The flavor could not be any better and the perfectly created thin crust let you enjoy the toppings as both a compliment and as a way to get it easily into your mouth Feels more like you have been invited to a friend s house for an awesome meal as opposed to a restaurant Great people and they went to all lengths to make ours and the other patrons meal fantastic even the entirely needy hard to please and somewhat obnoxious woman seated near us While I am sure they would make your super comfortable if you had to wait suggest you make a reservation so you can enjoy this great little place Had lunch at Bliss again still yummy as always This time I had the ceasar salad and their shoe string parmesan cheese fries I still recommend this place for lunch or dinner This neighborhood sushi bar is one of the best in AZ Fresh fish good portions and great service A place where not every single roll is filled with imitation crab and drenched in sauce Majority of their sushi menu is pretty traditional but the sushi chefs takes special requests if you give them an idea of what you like I especially like the Cucumber Fiesta which is a salmon yellowtail tuna roll wrapped in cucumber instead rice The staff is also very attentive They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars As I wait for a table I always see people greeted by name and received with hugs There must be a reason why people constantly come back right Check this place out and judge for yourself Amazing sushi Fast clean fresh Friendly staff Favorites are Arizona Beauty Alaska and Spicy Ninja although everything here is some of the best around hands down I picked up a jar of fresh made salsa and chips for the Superbowl party I was attending last Sunday because they are that outstanding They were a big hit If you are dining at the Blue Adobe definitely try the chips and salsa I am not a big fan of chipotle seasoning it is definitely one of the key ingredients but regardless I think it tastes great If you like it you can buy a jar of the fresh salsa and take it home with you for about it is a good sized jar In a sentance Four Peaks is DEFINATLY something to write Yelp about From the moment I realized that there were more reviews about this place than I d care to read in one sitting I knew this was going to be good I realized it was going to be fantastic when i pulled up with my friend Darius and we had a hard time finding a parking spot at pm We met a friend for lunch and the place was laid back chill clean cozy and yet modern perfect I had the French Dip thinly sliced roast beef on a nice hogie bun Everything was good not too salty not too greasy loved it Darius got the Fish N Chips and it was incredible Crispy batter dipped big pieces of fish iot was crispy and crunchy but soft and delightful on the inside The chips were also batter dipped and had great flavor I was in love this is my best recommendation for a meal at Four Peaks To my yelpers i say there is limited parking so when you pull up and see nothing but cars lining the street do NOT be alarmed there will be a table available Another thing get the fish n chips It s duh vine Beautiful parish also home to the amazing Legacy Ballroom that is available for wedding receptions and events The annual Middle East food festival is a wonderful family event with fantastic food pastry and entertainment Pancit palabok here is best outside of the Philippines Anyone can enjoy a quiet peaceful dinner on a Friday night Amazing This is often called the largest mall in Arizona and it shows Each time I ve done the usual mall walk I ve easily lost a few hours trying to see it all It s true that this isn t a place for anyone that doesn t care about fashion but this is a mall that s true to its name Fashion Center is no joke here Lots of high end designer stores lots of mid range affordable fashion stores and a few random familiar stops like Hallmark and Pottery Barn esque stores scattered through there A decent food court with a theater also conveniently down there But after spending so many hours at the mall who has time for a movie You can easily drop a few thousand here so be forewarned if you re on a budget Also I almost wish I had a map in my pocket because it can get confusing to remember which hallways you ve already explored And wear some comfortable walking shoes because it s not easy to get in and get out of this one But there s a good number of parking to use in a garage or few when you remember where you parked the car I d take any out of towner here unless they had a grudge against fashion classy stores or walking This is my favorite place to go for Greek food The owners are from Greece and frequently several family members are present The food is delicious large portions friendly service I wish they were located in Surprise but they are worth the drive I have been here multiple times and each time the staff has been superb Their selection is also awesome I would highly recommend Ahhh Four Peaks By far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix This place is fantastic as far as brew pubs go great beer and great food to go with it I can t believe I haven t taken the time to review it yet The Beer pretty consistently awesome All the beers are at least good my favorites being th Street Ale and their IPAs Hop Knot and Raj I have to say the Kiltlifter is a tad overrated but still pretty solid and worth a try I ve been meaning to try one of their cask conditioned ales but they always seem to be out probably indicative of the quality of those selections The Food fantastic I can t say that I ve ever had a bad meal at Four Peaks The Italian Beef Beer Bread is the best thing on the menu but you can t go wrong with the Chicken Fingers Chicken Salad Pita or really any of their sandwiches The fries are also great here there s a little crispy coating on the outside that is quite tasty Oh and the Spicy Thai Hummus is also a really good appetizer A little more liquidy than your average hummus but really good It has a nice little kick to it that will have you reaching for your beer Bottom line if you live in Phoenix like beer and enjoy eating a good meal then you should be shot if you don t like Four Peaks If you haven t been yet do yourself a favor and try it You ll come away happy I promise I went for both breakfast dinner two days in a row I got the commuter sandwich which was fabulous didn t think such simple ingredients could blow my mind I came back for dinner and got the kale quiona salad again very simple but amazing I need to come back and get the pizza my first time here at blue was great i came for happy hour I had the chicken wings and a chambord margarita both are fantastic service was friendly and fast This is the second time I ve eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first The first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places I ve been to in Phx It s very Back East feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there especially the meat cheese and pasta counters Check em out you won t be disappointed Just left I wanted to eat another pizza it was that good The Biagga was fantastic Probably the best prosciutto style pizza I ve ever had Owner and staff were very friendly I will be back again I ve got two names for you TYLER MARCO superstar instructors at the Y I ve been an avid gym member at various gyms for years and I have to say the YMCA downtown can t be beat for the p m work schedule person who likes to attend the gym during lunch or right after work I m all about the group exercise classes and this Y offers an array of classes such as spin kickboxing Zumba Yogalates Boot camp water aerobics Hatha Yoga etc etc Back to my fav instructors Tyler and Marco Boy do these boys kick my ass every time I take their classes Tyler teaches spin and offers not only strong knowledge and great tips on making your spin experience the best that it can be he has a kick ass playlist of music to motivate his class Marco is a very intense and interactive kickboxing instructor who keeps pushing you with great music mixes to keep his class sweating the weight and stress away Thank you Tyler and Marco for making my workouts intense and fun After years of going to different aerobic classes I m FINALLY seeing the results P S You can t beat the staff that works there Erica who manages all the group exercise instructor welcomes any suggestions or comments with a smile Freddie at the front desk is also very helpful and sweet Tried this place for the first time tonight and was impressed with absolutely everything Well lit building in a decent location in the Arcadia area I drove here from the Garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it Juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries along with one of the best slices of toast I ve ever had All three of these foods were still crispy when I got home which almost never happens with fast food I wish I had gotten the girl s name who took care of me She was cute as a button very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions I ll be back here soon I cannot get enough of LGO My favorite time to come is very early in the morning to enjoy the sun coming up over Camelback Mountain while having some organic coffee and a blackberry bran muffin The breakfast at LGO has something for everybody IMO Try the Croque M Dame if you want something really bold The lunch and dinner options are great too This is the only restaurant I have ever been that I could eat all three meals and feel like I was being served from a different kitchen each time The only draw back I can think of for LGO is the tendency for it to become very crowded That s the best problem a restaurant can have so they re probably not too worried about it The parking situation can become an issue too but for my time and money it s worth it LGO is top notch in my book and you can find me there pretty regularly Check this out I JUST HAD A RUBEN FOR BREAKFAST I saw the article about this place in the Tempe newspaper We were already heading to the Healing Field at Tempe Town Lake and wanted to stop for breakfast We had the dogs with us so choices were limited My boyfriend went into Stan s and they let us sit on the patio with the pups They serve their entire menu all day I m not a huge eggs and bacon kind of person so I love having something a little different in the morning I ordered the Ruben and allowed Kelly the waitress who was fabulous to choose the side The food took a little while to arrive When it did Holy Cow My sandwich was huge and she brought all three sides so we could taste them all That is great customer service My favorite was the slaw then potato salad The food was fabulous and the staff was more than accommodating The owner stopped by our table and chatted awhile I will no doubt be back Thank you so much Stan s for the wonderful start to my day We have been here now several times This Is one of the best restaurants we have ever been to The food and service is absolutely the best Most everything is cooked in their exposed kitchen Everything off the grill is awesome The servers will patiently answer all your questions and appear as though they really enjoy seeing you pleased with your experience Since we have been here several times here is a list of some items we have had For one if you don t mind spending the money the toro tour is great They have something like different kinds of toro From real fatty to a little less Melts in your mouth The presentation is very impressive It is served on ice with different kinds of salt and to us a very unique way of presenting the wasabi All there other sushis are served perfectly prepared The steak is excellent The flavor is spectacular grilled in view over an open flame and quite literally cooked always and without fail exactly to you specification All tempura dishes are great Grilled zucchini Very good and juicy Seabass with miso Cooked perfectly I suggest you order to share and sit at the counter It makes for a very good experience This is the place where you should go in without worrying about cost Just go for it tske your time and experience it all It will make for a very good experience Try their very unique drinks they are very refreshing Or if you are real daring the tasting menu is literally a hour experience Did it once It s a bit long for us and wont do it again The best street taco s i ve had As authentic and cheap as it gets If you do take out pick up a bombaros burrito for lunch for the next day as well its really hot but tasty Don t tell me ATF or any other spot is better they dont come close unless you like your street tacos with sour cream cheese and lettuce LOL I love Jimmy Johns All I can say is DELICIOUS Service was great food was great and the restaurant looks beautiful Fried Squash blossoms How do they come up with this stuff FnB gets stars for creativity and service oh and the food is pretty amazing too The menu changes with the season so I apologize in advance for making your mouth water by mentioning food you ll probably never taste We started off with the appetizer special Fried Squash blossoms stuffed with burrata served with fresh tomato sauce and an order of naan with eggplant puree The Naan plate was nothing special but the blossoms were fantastic For dinner Hottie had the lab chops with couscous and I had the pasta with butternut squash and pesto The pasta was amazing I watched the chef make my pesto to order mmmm basil Hottie devoured every bite so I would say he enjoyed his chops too For desert we shared the panna cotta with cherries it was the perfect ending to a great meal This place gets starts all the way from the moment we walked in the service was impeccable and the food was superb Thank you FnB Pauli from ATL checking in here just for a bit of nostalgia I used to live in Phoenix a few years back and of all the places I miss eating at this is on my list I remember how I first heard of the place I was over at a friend s house in Scottsdale having a few beers after work and remember asking him what his favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix was My friend who had more than just a few beers in him stared at me all glassy eyed got right in my face and said Cheeeeno Banddddeeedo As I backed up a bit thinking my friend had too much to drink he had for sure I wondered hmmm the Chinese Bandit What the hell is that place about Or is he just f ing with me So I asked him what kind of food they serve there And as he did his best to focus on me when his eyes hit mine there was this long pause and he had this expression on his face that I can t forget I wasn t sure if he was having trouble putting it into words or if he was sh ing in his pants And then he put his hands together like a nutjob working a Rubik s cube and said They dooo things like egg foooo youngggg burrritos and jaaaade red chicken tacossssss as he gave me another crazy ass look the kind that tells you it s time to say goodnight and get outta there which I did So a few days later I remembered his drunken explanation of Chino Bandido and thought I would go check the place out And from that point on I was hooked Egg foo young burritos indeed And jerk fried rice And those refried black beans with fire in the bungholio sauce mixed in Yep those will burn you twice All served in a giant disposable aluminum baking dish And you got that combo along with a soda and tip for about WOW At that time I had never seen anything like it before and I still miss eating there more than any of my favorite old haunts in Phoenix I wish somebody would franchise one out to Atlanta I would be the first customer in the door on opening day guaranteed Wow Being a Phoenix native we have enjoyed many a meals at the hands of Chef Gross But this past weekend I was blown away I was planning a large garden party for my friends bridal shower The record temperatures left my garden ravaged by the heat and I did not want to have sweltering ladies unable to enjoy themselves After a small response to attendance I decided to see what some of my favorite dining spots could offer me I had a small budget but wanted to keep it classy Christopher s truly rose to the occasion Alex was my special event contact and this lady was on it Emails and phone calls were returned at lightning speed She presented a delightful menu with plenty of choices some even for the vegetarians attending all with in my price range We had a wonderful time We had a party of in the beautiful private room that fit our festivities perfectly Sundays can be quiet at The Biltmore Fashion Park so it lend ed us to a bit of intimacy that was nice Ben was our go to guy He was right there for every thing we needed and his helpers were polite and attentive As for the food well it s Chris come on I had the vegetable risotto ans it was cooked to perfection All of the plates came out of the kitchen quickly and all together but no one ever made us feel rushed Wine flowed desserts were gobbled up and the ladies oohed and awed over everything the staff even offered to take gifts to the car for the bride Thanks for saving me Chef Chris and your team You were all fabulous and I will be telling all of my friends what a great job you did The holidays are coming and Ben reminded us that they also do catering Hmmm can you say Christmas Party I just purchased a new Sorento here and my experience was amazing Mike Bergesson was super easy to work with and got me a great deal I live miles away and there are closer Kia dealerships but I would do business with Salazar Kia over the others any day Thanks i stopped by here on a lunch break because the sign said appraisals by appointment the owner indra was there and willing to do the appraisal on my engagement ring while i waited without an appointment yay he cleaned my ring at no charge inspected it and provided the retail value at no charge indra told me a written appraisal for insurance purposes is only a bargain compared to what others in the valley are charging the stock of jewelry was lovely a nice mix of new and used pieces some very unique one of a kind finds as well i found a few things i would prefer not to live without they do all their own importing and buy sell and trade jewelry i felt he was very honest about my ring the cash value he stated was in line with numbers i heard from other jewelers and he was charming and helpful answering questions and educating me while i ogled over diamonds and pearls i will return to have my watch batteries replaced a pair of earrings changed from yellow to white gold and pretty much anything else i can think of i trusted him immediately which when dealing with diamonds is of paramount importance to me I do not understand less than four stars We had six different plates Beet Salad Rabit Butter Scallops Strawberry desert and Peach desert All were brilliant Our favorite both agreed was the Beet Salad It was so fresh and had a perfect combo of flavors and textures Service was way more than perfect One note they are now BYOB with a corkage fee for Beer and Wine No fee if the Beer or Wine is from Arizona One note for FnB we were preplexed with the lack of pork on the menu Good micro brew made right there Food is good as well Hands down best slices in Scottsdale AAAAMAZING They have the best hot dogs and corn dogs i have ever had It is definitely a place to try if you love hot dogs They have good fries excellent onion rings and very very reasonable prices I have never met a single person who has said anything but incredible things about Ted s definitely a must try Try the Larb it is on happy hour and it even comes in tofu as a veggie option This one dish alone at happy hour would make me love this place but there were many more delights that made my visit so great I don t drink with dinner but here it was happy hour all day sat and they had a unique drink the Curry Gimlet IT comes in a martini glass has a orange hue it is fruity but has a curry finish from cardamom I assume truly unique Our dishes of Pad See ewe and Dragon noodles were great and huge portions Rich flavors well textured tofu and crisp veggies When I made my reservation I let them know about the birthday of the person I was with We were surprised with fried banana and ice cream along with a candle and signing it was great I woke up this morning craving a breakfast burrito Fortunately just days ago a menu was left on our door for Cisco s Grill with some great marketing I might add Conveniently located right up the street from my house I ve been curious about this place since they opened I strapped on my shoes and walked on over upon entering I was greeted cordially and placed my order for a chorizo and egg burrito with cheese The cook went to work and minutes later I was holding a fresh hot burrito and a complimentary pineapple water Cisco came out and introduced himself while I was waiting and chatted with me for a few minutes Its clear to me that he s very passionate about his restaurant The service is top notch The menu itself is fairly generic typical burger and fries tacos and burritos but everything is so fresh and prepared well I d recommend this joint to anyone looking for a quick inexpensive bite to eat I walked in and uttered I think I found my new home Miller High Life on draught and bottle Buckhunt the lil orange gun has even been taped together double buck bonus Bowling videogame god I love these things Indoor smoking lounge With a large screen TV two tables and a lot of pleather seating the large fan won t mean much but WOW exciting There is a french style door separating the lounge from the bar area where the stage is so you can still peak at the band while sucking tar Well even the womens bathroom is pretty gnarly which would normally subtract a star but I was so happy to pee in the unmarked restroom I won t touch it Other notes all bartender barbacks security were extremely sweet and friendly all other patrons were either pretty chill excited to see the band that was playing or willing to strike up conversation tons of televisions everywhere they had a lot of beers on tap cheap too this place is HUGE In fact I would consider it a liability since there are a lot of steps connecting each section at times I found myself balancing precariously and that is b c I am a klutz wasn t even drunk ok not that drunk Most everyone had tats black hair laid back This is def not a scene and I love that I have long liked Tempe Maretplace since it has opened It is a good location lots of parking all around Since when live in the extreme heat it is a bit nice that it is outdoors There is a major selection or stores restaurants and services here My girlfriend likes it as well So it is a win win set up They are decorated really well and they have a multitude of events here Even a Barnes and Noble which bookstores are not that easy to come accross now days This is by far my favourite department store hands down I have had nothing but perfect experiences in this store without exception no matter what department I m in The shoe SA s will bend over backwards to help you find a specific shoe and the staff will even go so far as to send out hand written thank you cards to your home address after you make a purchase big or small Tim Anthony in the shoe salon are fabulous beyond words I am not completely sure that I understand why people complain about the amount of merchandise on the floor or the lack of crowds in this store Frankly I would rather not be bombarded with merchandise and other people One of the things I love the most about Barney s is not only the prompt attention of SA s but the fact that they aren t rushing around trying to help people at once The SA s at Barney s are incredibly friendly and will stop to have an actual conversation regardless or whether you are purchasing something or not I have also never experienced a high pressure sale situation here All in all Barneys is pricey and there is no getting around it But um so is Neiman s and that place is a crock Anywhere that ONLY accepts American Express or their charge card and then treats you like scum if you aren t carrying neither is no place that I want to spend my hard earned dollars Yay Barneys I love the fish tacos from Rubios I always order them Well sometimes I get the shrimp or Salmon tacos and I also love that black salsa chipotle sauce and the chips are delish here Every time I visit Arizona I love to eat here to food is vary good and I have my wife to thank for turning me on too this restaurant I wish they would have some in Georgia i always forget about this place when we do a party they carry costumes and party gear year round even halloween stuff stopped in today to look for a flintstones costume but they had no Fred s and the wilma they had for bucks we bought on line for bucks i had an online coupon for bucks so i only bought house decor for halloween but if you need any kind of prop for a costume theme party bike pub ride or just feel like dressing up this place is perfect If you re looking for a lunch salad Sandwich this place is great Not too busy but that s good because it s very quaint The roost beef and bluecheese sandwich will fill your stomach and the cookie side is a nice treat Every time I go into this place its with good times and cheery mates and I leave the wiser with a pint of fresh brew and some of the best food To make a great date go to the Phoenix Rock Gym first and then climb the ladder on the back wall and walk in around the back Great times for every one Gymboree many years ago I brought my first son to Gymboree quite often and really enjoyed Never thought I would be back but now we have another gymboree tike and he loves it I am very happy to have been reintroduced to Gymboree and have already made plans to go again with my son next week The instructor made it look easy and really communicated very well with both parents and children Thinking about Gymboree now my only regret is that I know someday my boy is going to outgrow it and I want these times to last forever I ve been coming to Yusefs now for awhile to get gyro meat to go along with their fresh feta pitas and cucumber yogurt BEST I VE HAD Finally I was able to eat there as they have a kitchen and OMG it was delis and the prices are fabulous I ordered the lentil soup and holy cow it was UNREAL I got the gyro plate with gyro meat and fresh rice basmati and it was fabulous Gyro Greek salad was amazing too I love coming here because the owner is nice and very sweet I recommend you try this little gem It s worth the drive Not many places that you can go and get a natural casing charred white hot dog outside of western NY Folks I know from Western NY love this place and I have to agree even though I ll still take a good Chicago dog any day I know where I ll be going if I ever have an itch for a white hot Good God where has this been hiding My bf and I just made our periodic trip to Phoenix and discovered this little gem From his kids no less We went during the pm pm Happy Hour on a Friday night We got a table in about minutes for of us Our server was super friendly and took our drink order right away The cosmos and appletinis were and the sake bombs with Kirin or Sapporo were and numerous rolls were each how do you beat that The food was spectacular We ordered off of the regular menu orders or tuna tataki orders of heart attacks and a dragon roll and the happy hour menu crispy spicy tuna philadelphia roll calamari roll shrimp tempura roll and a couple of others that I can t seem to remember OMG one slice of that tuna tataki and I was SOLD This was some seriously great sushi Bravo Yen Sushi Our bill for peeps was that s with the tip included no less YAY I will definitely be back I absolutely LOVE this place Their pizza is in my top as far as the selection in Arizona and the ONLY downside is that the Tempe location to my knowledge still doesn t have any of the pasta dishes that some of the other locations have The crust is always perfect the sauce is sweet but with just the right amount of spice to it and the cheese and toppings are flawless On top of having some of the best pizza in town their customer service is top notch If you haven t tried Spinato s yet put it on your to do list Green how I love thee Green may be vegan vegetarian but I certainly wouldn t claim it to be health food Green is located in a small run down strip mall adjacent to Kore Bicycles on the NW corner of Scottsdale Road and McKellips It doesn t look like much from the outside and without knowing of Green you probably wouldn t do a second take upon passing it however the food here is no less than amazing The decor is unique and fresh tables a couch lounge area random artwork on the walls painted quotes lights hanging from the ceiling and old painted car doors along one wall I ve tried a random assortment of items from the menu and nothing has disappointed me but by far my favorite is the BBQ Chicken sandwich along with an appetizer of the spicy buffalo wings I believe the mock chicken Green uses is fungus based Quorn perhaps may not sound appetizing but it is freaking awesome I am not personally vegan or even vegetarian for that matter but Green has me hooked I ve forced many of my meat eating friends to try Green and they have all become believers if you could call sharing something so wonderful forcing Great prices great dishes unique fun atmosphere and great service On one Saturday evening around my boyfriend and I decided to pick up some Green to go the place had a line out the door and it took about min to get our food We weren t even upset about the wait just waited patiently for our delicous order and upon arrival the server gave us two free entree tickets for our next visit and apologized THIS is how you keep your customers coming back for MORE Love this place so much Angel sweet is without a doubt the best gelato I ve had outside of Italy We Care Family Wellness Center is the most exceptional doctor s office and staff that I have ever found Every employee here genuinely cares about you I highly recommend Best damn Brownies on the planet or close to it Words cannot explain how good they are The only negative is that this palce is located across the street from my office Way too much temptation I ve been to this Dick s location a bunch of times and I ve got to say that I ve gotten more help from the employees in this one that I ve ever gotten from any other location I ve spent some major time with the guys in the gun dept and they re always more that helpful regardless of how busy and how many people they have waiting for them Major props to those guys for good knowledge and patience Another time I was there I wanted some new shorts for softball and they didn t have and L s left but jokingly I checked the Under Armour manikin as he was wearing the same shorts and what do ya know L It was near closing time and the associates were getting their stuff done so they could go home I ve worked retail and I know at closing time you just want everybody to bail so you can clean and go home I asked a girl around the corner I was able to rob the manikin of his clothes and she laughed and had no problem taking him apart and yankin the shorts right off I was so happy as I had a game the next day and didn t want to be running around looking for these shorts Think I m joking lol http www flickr com photos ryno Anyways good store always clean and everybody seems very nice and knowledgable in their area Never had an issue there I found some great t shirts for friends here including one from a local PHX artist with a grinning skull If you re a hipster or looking to buy gifts for one then this is the place to go Plus the clerk was using a Mac not that I would expect anything different but bonus verisimilitude points for fitting in with your surroundings Mr Clerk I love Jimmy Johns It is WAY better than Subway The bread is what makes it They bake their own bread right in the store and then right before they make your sandwich they pluck out the middle of the bread to fill your sandwich with goodness You choose your sandwiches by number but you can customize any sandwich I usually get the which is a Tom Turkey It has turkey lettuce tomato lettuce and sprouts on it I like their chips too They call them Jimmy Chips They are the kettle cooked type I personally do not think this is your ordinary sandwich The combination of bread and ingredients makes it a great sandwich and they are fast to prepare I dropped in to SweetRepublic finally because they tweeted about their Chocolate Guinness and a limited edition Jameson Irish Cream I have had their ice cream in the past both from the truck and at other events and was already a fan Now I m fanatical The Jameson was amazingly good I couldn t believe how well the flavor was represented without having the harshness of the alcohol bite But the Chocolate Guinness won the day It was so good I ordered a pint to take home Unexplainably it is still in the freezer I will remedy that today The location is right by my work so I anticipate returning again and again Jan and Helen are wonderful girls and they have created something truly amazing I congratulate them and look forward to more of their creations And their commitment to using local ingredients makes me happy to spend my money there rather than a chain who doesn t concern themselves with the area The Great Indoors is a phenomenal place to get lost and dream about what you would like to have your home look like WARNING You will want to spend money On average their prices are pretty run of the mill dept store style it is their selection that is amazing They have far more selection than any other store I have ever been to The store is also well organized and laid out and everything is easy to find One final note while not a place for extreme bargain hunters if you play your cards right you can get some great deals I just purchased all of our appliances for our home at a discount Again not the best discount I have seen but getting them all at once not having to look around and still getting back for every I spend is pretty darn nice Oh and if you need appliances ask for Andy Andrew He is a great help and honest as can be This is one of my favorite theaters With that said I suggest you prepare yourself for having to wade through an onslaught of pre teen cliques if you plan on making your way to the ticket counter on a Friday or Saturday evening If you re like me safety is a concern Not to worry here I ve always seen an officer on premises during the main drop the kids off pick the kids up window This location still has a new feeling to it and it is clean and cool Nice cushy seats with cup holders and I have yet to hear the soles of my shoes stick to the floor as I walk down an aisle My favorite seats are the ones with the railing in front A place to perch my feet Swoop Having worked in the Scottsdale Airpark area going on years or so I ve eaten lunch just about everywhere There are plenty of good places but not many ethnic places Indian Paradise has the distinction of being both great and ethnic I ve only ever eaten there for the lunch buffet and it is AMAZING I keep thinking that I m gonna be disappointed eventually But every single time I have dined here I have come away extremely satisfied and in dire need of a nap I keep asking myself how can it be so good Is it cocaine Cocaine in the food Is it They have different buffet items on different days but the the mainstay curry chicken remains a favorite of mine On Friday there is a mushroom dish that I dream about and on Thursday they have stuffed jalapenos that are a little hot but oh so gooooooood Be sure to save some room for the rice pudding cause it s delicious ALTERNATIVE That s what this place is and in the land of BIG chains this only could add some spice We were welcomed here to the free screening of Dale and Tucker Vs Evil as part of a Yelp event The personnel is totally committed to their project If you are looking some retro movies or the gender I don t enjoy but others do horror this is a good alternative Great fresh food and vegetarian options I will definitely return Whenever I get my car cleaned this is the place that I ll always go to They re nice efficient and they do a great job My car is still shining a week later The wait is very minimal The staff works together fantastically and you can watch them clean your car so you don t have to worry about anything getting stolen Yeah it s a little small and a bit shabby but like the first reviewer said you don t go there for the waiting experience Definitely worth the money Saw this place on Triple D so I decided to give her try My expectations were high and when I arrived I was shocked that on a Thursday morning the line was extra extra long Had to wait patiently which when it comes to food I don t like But needless to say the wait was worth it because when I got in there I was served quickly I ordered the pork chop eggs and hash browns The pork chop there is fabulous and the toast and home made grape jelly was good I would recommend this place for breakfast to anyone who is in the downtown area of Phoenix Make sure to try the bacon too This place has been here years and we have never been Are you kidding me The food is excellent The people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there which is most important I tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich YUMMY There are many choices for salad toppings There us nothing I like more than a huge fresh salad I chose to top my salad with avocado tomato bacon edemame feta cheese and whipped balsamic vinaigrette I really think this was the best salad I have ever had They make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing I chose the chicken pesto sandwich The combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl The sandwich was excellent My hubby ordered the Cuban pork sandwich This is one huge sandwich It was difficult to get his mouth around it but once he did it was awesome Typically we don t like coleslaw but it was really good especially combined with the tender pork We will return to the Market Bistro again and again Loved it I m a bit of a snob I admit it I generally prefer the full service pamper me kind of salons that charge an arm and a leg But times are tight and I want my nails and my money Enter Biagio When you first walk into Biagio you would think you had walked into a fancy day spa But when you read the prices you wonder how they can stay in business A spa pedicure one of the most expensive treatments is a whopping I say whopping with a sense of sarcasm Not only do you get a great pedicure best I ve EVER received but you get a leg and neck massage yes the chairs are massage chairs but real hands give you a real massage A spa manicure which also comes with a neck massage is The technicians are very nice the store is immaculate the tools are all sterilized and the treatments are very high quality even for a snob like me Plus the atmosphere makes you feel like you are at a spa not a strip mall dive nail salon I highly recommend Biagio I have been there several times and plan to go back often These are some great cheesesteaks I have come here multiplier times and have never left unhappy The staff are nice and the food is delicious Also try the Cheesesteak Fries they are freakin amazing I am glad I work next to this place always a great lunch This location is quieter than the one at Arizona Mills Mall No screaming kids in your way The clothes are less disheveled still attached to the hanger but for the same low price I get my husband s work shirts here for like Ross understands that there are still skinny Americans out there and they carry size pants YESSSSS I the unusual house goods you can find at Ross I redid my whole bathroom and made it into a nice Victorian style in light pink and a wood brown They had this soft green painted shelf that looked like a twisted vine Where else can you find something like that I found these two toothbrush cups that were painted with butterflies Worth the each My bathroom is gorgeous You ll want to take a crap in there I LOVE this place I have been craving their Baked Spaghetti Pie again for years and I finally got it today since I m back for a business trip I remember pretty much everything on their menu is fresh and delicious Their prices are great too Very polite staff Best Thai food for your dollar in the entire valley I m no Thai expert but I have been to at least a dozen here in the valley Keep in mind this is NOT a fancy place just a simple inexpensive casual dining experience WOW Excuse me How in the world have I lived walking distance from Cornish Pasty Company for over a month and have only barely heard of this gem Thats what I want to know A friend introduced us to Cornish Pasty saying it is the best restaurant ever I best give it a try then right The Tempe location is smaller than the Mesa location but I LOVE its vibe A small narrow walking space between people sitting at a counter behind the kitchen and people sitting at teeny tiny tables dim lit lighting and candles and for the most part pretty good music My man and I ordered the Mexican Pasty and the Rosemary Chicken Pasty They were unbelievable SO GOOD The Mexican Pasty was definitely the better of the two but I d order both of them again any day A little heavy dinner action to make a girl feel full and happy I respect restaurants that have a plethora of vegetarian options What generation are you living in if you don t offer veggie options these days Get with the program all you other restaurants You know who you are I loved the entire experience and can t wait for our next trip off with a Yelp check in SCORE They have very unique colorful and patterned vintage clothing for sale But what I liked most about this store is their vintage jewelry There s a local jeweler who makes rings out of old school buttons and brooches I snatched up two really cute vintage rings They have a new and improved menu and added more Korean dishes Very good I ve been there times since they added the new menu and it s been good every time Very authentic Korean food This is my favorite spot now The dishes I had so far Champong Bulgogi Sul lung tang Neng myun Galbi Yukgejang All were very good I can t wait to go back and try other food Neng myun cold noodle was especially good on muggy hot summer days Good choice of ingredients a bit out of a student budget but it was WORTHY all the way I was drooling with the flavors Good environment and good service and good music bistro style I m not much of a pizza eater but this has a good place in my list Forget about your papa dough or cheap Sunday pizzas this is a real one We stopped in to Copper Blues on Friday night after a Mercury game at the US Airways Center Fantastic place Unbelievable beer selection great views of downtown and an excellent band the night that we were there made for a really great downtown experience Will definitely be back again soon Great ambiance though a tad noisy food service and views For our meals we got the following Amuse bouche I forgot what it was exactly but it consisted of tumeric wild rice and a piece of shrimp Tasty and a nice introduction although the rice was annoying to eat with our forks Appetizer Bread with dips The pepper pesto was hands down the winner and the other two aren t worth mentioning Butter lettuce salad Decent but a little too sweet for me Lobster bisque Very rich and creamy with a kick of smoky flavor Entree Halibut Best dish in recent memory Get this Just do it Roasted cauliflower risotto Came with very tender pieces of beef The risotto was cooked well but it was unfortunately too salty for me to properly enjoy Dessert Espresso cup The ice cream was delicious The rest of it was okay After dinner we took a trip outside to take in the view We also explored the surroundings around the entrance but it only led to an empty lot with the unflattering presence of a dumpster Oh well The service was great from the host calling to confirm the rsvp an hour after it was booked on opentable to the sommelier suggesting a great bottle of wine to the server making sure there was a candle in the dessert Two thumbs up Totally coming back once it cools down to be able to dine drink outside Woohoo I LOVE THIS PLACE I JUST CAN T NOT GET ENOUGH OF NCOUNTER the vibe is young clean and fresh the good is so delish I keep telling all my friends to go here for brunch By far the best poker room in the state and I have played in every casino poker room in the valley The action is always there lots of dead money to be picked up if you know where to look Good promotions amazing food served table side and all the sports games you can watch I wish they would bring back limit but will have to do such an improvement over the tents though they will always hold a place in my heart It sucks cause I work right next to the casino and every night after work I have a tough decision go home to my family or go to my favorite card room and tear it up If you havent been there MUST GO Kids love Disney and so do I One of my favorite things at this location as opposed to the AZ Mills location is the magic princess mirror Grab any of the princess items shoes tiara wand etc off the rack and wave the package with the UPC symbol facing the jewels and mirror and after a few seconds that particular princess will appear in the mirror with a little story for the kids Ok I ll say this up front I don t like chains There are just far too many awesome restaurants in Phoenix Scottsdale to go to a chain That being said this place is amazing and the quality and consistency here is unreal Yes it seems expensive but once you ve eaten here you ll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth So much awesome unlimited red meat Don t let them trick you with the salad bar It s killer but don t fill up And don t be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on GREEN the sign of meat greed hahahahaha Lastly try the Tres Leches and the Key Lime Pie out of this world I LOVE this place This is my sushi bar Danny one of the two sushi chef s is awesome I have always found their sushi to be very fresh About a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu With rolls like these Dirty Harry Mr Miagi Rio you cannot go wrong Especially if you like spicy like me Even the non sushi is great This is one place my year old loves that doesn t have a drive through window Also sake bombs Go here Try it Don t be scared off by a couple of so so ok bad reviews I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled Almost forgot They have some big screen TV s Watch sports here They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football Just go Now Seriously Review part is over You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here You could be finding your keys Putting on socks and shoes Hell skip the socks Wear sandals Save time Just when I m about to give up on my search for good Thai around Glendale I stumble upon a true diamond in the rough Don t be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel Much like that feeling the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door The food that I ve tried here so far is may I say it divine I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste Score I also tried some papaya salad and once again it was mounded in fish sauce and chili Splendid Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow which is not on the menu and lo and behold I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way To be honest the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce again drizzled all over your concoction Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre It will pay off handsomely One of our Lexus car keys key fob was cracked and needed to be replaced Going to the dealer would be anywhere from I found Alcatraz on Yelp and called Todd Todd did exactly what he said had to be done and the charge was Todd is knowledgeable and knows what he is doing Most other locksmiths couldn t do the job because they don t have the machine necessary to fabricate the key I am a home inspector in the Phoenix metro area and before I left with my new key I took more than a few of Todd s business cards that I plan to give to my clients so that when they move into their new home they can call someone who is reliable knowledgeable and trustworthy to help with their home security Thanks Yelp as I found Alcatraz on your site Fantastic Absolutely fantastic I recommend OHSO for anyone looking to dine at a neighborhood bar and grill I was really shocked when I dined at OHSO for a Sunday brunch I figured the variety of beers would be the focal point of the brewery boy was I wrong This place has some of the best dishes in Scottsdale supported by a huge selection of beer Let me say this with more clarity great food differentiates this place not the huge variety of beers This is a great achievement considering many breweries focus on providing rare beers with mediocre food The Burger Cheese is simply awesome A GREAT brunch dish is the Breakfast Burrito as well as the Breakfast Flatbread Love their pizza and atmosphere Their Caesar salad is really good too They had a great deal during the summer where we got salads large pepperoni pizza and a bottle of wine for Awesome carne asada veggie taco and just about everything else Delicious and very easy on my wallet Huge fan of Bikram yoga It s a minute torturous at times sweat filled workout but when you are done you feel insanely amazing The feeling continues throughout the day leaving you in complete zen Road rage Gone Annoying food cravings Zero Jeans Fitting awesome You really must try it it can completely change your body There are a few places in the valley that offer Bikram most of them exclusively rather than in combo with other methods of yoga The Bikram Institute on Miller and Indian School is where I first tried it and I like it the best so far They offer classes throughout the day and later in the evening as well Like other studios this place offers first timers a week long pass for around What I really like about this studio is their instructors and the fact that they keep their room darkened throughout the entire practice I ve have been going to another studio lately for their first time student deals and their instructors bark out instructions non stop plus they keep the lights on the whole time So when you re staring up lying in your relaxed state your eyes meet the glare of the fluorescent I ll very likely return here after I ve exhausted the new student deals at the studios around the valley Yoga can be expensive GREAT PLACE TO HANG OUT AND WATCH THE SCENERY With a little help you can drink choose from about beers scothes whiskeys Really good tequila s just ask me along with the every day vodka s some pretty impresive wines or whines Don t miss this little gem in the rough com listen to music or watch sports or just drink Oh yea the owners are OK also I don t drink a lot of coffee but I m a fan of tea Especially strange tea that I probably can t pronounce right Oh and I like it when it smells like scotch Yep I m a fan of Lapsang Souchong But I m not a fan of foofy And that s one thing that Tea infusion is not It s not foofy It s funky It s fun And everyone who works there is really friendly Beyond the teas the food is good too I don t know that I d eat there every night but it s a wider variety than I d expect at a tea place This is a regular stop of mine Makes Tempe Markeplace worth it I LOVE the pretzels Wish they would bring back the Asiago Dip but hey garlic salt and cabs are of my main food groups Great atmosphere can always see a game on one of the many TVs even when my girlfriend thinks I m paying attention to her Milk stout is my favorite beer but the light isn t bad either Something tells me the others are good too but it s hard to get me to stray from my patterns Oh well I ll leave someone else to review those All in all the food and beer is great and the servers seem to know what they re doing too My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short Greeted immediately Lots of variety Meat lovers pizza is amazing Ask for Tawnya she s really nice and a wonderful server Will be back loved the excellent service I take the light rail downtown sometimes just to go here I walked in the first time to a bustling energetic singing cheering crowd and thought where the H am I I felt like I had left Phoenix and ended up in a far away magical land of wonder and excitement Food is decent for a bar great beer great local music it s the first time I saw The Waters Downtown Phoenix needs more places like this Great food Good service Salsa is the best Enchiladas are very good I don t know what they put in the sauce but damn is it good No better Mexican food anywhere in Scottsdale Really good pizza has to be among the most perfect foods in all the world Really good pizza would likely be on my last meal request list Specifically the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza at La Grande Orange Pizzeria which has to be near the top of the list for all the great pizzas the two us who contributed to this review have consumed And that is a lot of pizza We were visiting Scottsdale as tourists when the concierge at the resort recommended this place to us Bless her Very convenient too to be able to shop for wine at La Grande Orange grocery adjoining and other goodies while we waited on our take out pizza order http www yelp com biz la grande orange grocery phoenix hrid cXbhzxxtmExF kRjmFViQ src self The only hitch here is parking is terrible during peak hours So it goes The pizza is worth the parking hassle We re on our way back to Scottsdale in a few days for another visit and La Grande Orange Pizzeria is on our go list again The Rocket Man pizza is calling our name this time Tanzy Yelp and Lindsey deserve the biggest standing O for this event I honestly think I am still full from the generous food options that kept flowing I kept thinking we were done but OH NO here comes another course I felt like I was at a chef tasting menu dinner Right when we got there we had a glass of Champagne and were seated with a olive and meat plate followed by some bruschetta and local made cheese After the event officially started we were hit with amazing course after amazing course With never empty glasses of wine My Favs Sweet Corn Risotto Scallops cooked to perfection with a parsnip puree mmmmmmmm Alaskan King Salmon Center Cut Filet Mignon Brussel Sprouts yes Brussel Sprouts Tempura battered with a sweet relish AMAZING hour braised beef short rib Talk about melt in your mouth Red Velvet Bread Pudding I will go back just for this anytime I am near the Quarter I can t wait to go back to Tanzy for a full meal but I don t know how I will be able to top this evening of amazing food I was very surprised to hear they have been open for years as I was really blown away with their food and service Thanks again to everyone who helped put together this amazing event what a great way to end Pita Jungle is now one of my favorite places to go for dinner It s both affordable and healthy Thought it s usually crowded with Hipster ASU students I have yet to receive bad service Our food has usually come out in a timely matter As for the environment It s very nicely decorated with art from local artists and it s very well lit It s nice and open so you can see what s going on through out the restaurant It s never to noisy so it would be a great place to take a family or even a date Almost every visit I ve always gotten either the Broiled Chicken Salad or the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap The chicken has always been moist and dish is always flavorful The lemon vinaigrette dressing is almost good enough to drink Though I have not tried a lot on the menu some of the food they bring out always make me say Ooh what s that Easy star fun at the Phoenix Zoo I ve never seen critters so closeup before At the Monkey Village they don t even have cages The giraffes came right up to us I spent half my beer money on fishheads and shrimp feeding the stingrays It was a blast We had great time yow bill PS I ve never commented on other people s reviews before But jeez When someone goes to the zoo and complains about the cost of a hot dog or a snow cone well for spider monkey s sake get a clue They say you never forget your first Well Postino Central was my first Postino and I remember my first sip and bite like it was yesterday The atmosphere here is very sexy at night Candlelight and sexy music add to the already chic ambience Postino has The food Bliss I can still remember how the creamy ricotta and sweet figs on my bruschetta tantalized my tongue that first night I can feel the velvety red wine at the back of my mouth and drizzling down my throat Parking is a bit of a hassle but they have valet for a reason If you re stuck waiting for a table squeeze in at the bar and grab a glass of wine or three People watching is almost as fun here as eating Now that there is a Postino in the East Valley I am hoping Postino Central will get a little less busy if only to serve my selfish purposes I love everything about this place and I hope to be back soon everytime my sister comes to town we go striaght from the airport to Karsh s our intent is to buy bagels and we do but we can never stop there and wind up with a variety of goodies all that we have comsumed over the years has been really great as for service always with a smile and friendly attitude we used to go here all the time when we lived on n central but since we moved to the other side of the world it has become a special occasion place so please open one near us too Hands down the best Vietnamese food we ve found in metro Phoenix Enormous bowls of delicious pho served quickly with friendly and efficient service Our go to place for pho now Cheap too So far I have been to Lola twice a Saturday night and Monday morning Saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy Monday morning Free Wi Fi coffee baked goods and awesome location you can t beat it The morning we went we had a Monterrey Jack scone that was really good I laughed when I got my latte in a So I Married an Axe Murder esque cup We sat along the high tables facing Central Ave and I really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards Central There are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables I really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular you ll never get to sit there That is why I stopped going to Lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time My favorite part of Lola coffee is being right on Central and watching traffic and the light rail go past Love it love it Even though I ve only been to Bosa once I ve had the donuts from here several times My parents have been coming here regularly like multiple times a week regularly since this place opened and every time I come to visit they make sure to get me donut in the morning when they know I m hungover in bed Now I m only reviewing this place for the donuts I didn t even know this place served other breakfasty stuff until I came here myself but the other pastries coffee drinks sound good as well That being said when it comes to donuts Bosa is as good as it gets They re soft chewy and all around yummy that goes for all varieties well the ones I ve tasted anyway Another good thing they re CHEAP It s not like donuts break the bank anyway but even compared to chain donut places the donuts here practically cost nothing The place itself is not much to look at but who cares All I want is the donuts Having spent lots of time in Sonora Mexico over the years visiting family I have always sought a place here in Arizona that provides an honest and quality duplication of the food I have had south of the border At Sonora Mesquite Grill I have found such a place that makes food on the spot using only fresh ingredients and genuine care for your experience You can always go elsewhere and maybe get your food faster maybe have a plasma TV in your face but I m willing to bet that your food started out frozen and going through a thawing process in a microwave Celina the kind and welcoming owner wants people to receive the absolute best food possible This painstaking process means long hours for her every day preparing the beef and chicken over a mesquite fire No there are no large corporate chain gimmicks or cut corners Sonora Mesquite Grill simply provides good food at a good price without the use of preservatives and loads of fat Is Sonora Mesquite Grill for everyone Perhaps not but it is a great choice for someone looking for genuinely authentic modest great tasting and healthy food with the taste of Sonora If going for the first time make sure to order the silky and flavorful guacamole and salsas Finish your meal with a fresh and homemade razpado to truly cap off a great meal at Sonora Mesquite Grill Simple and great flavors at their very best This is my current first choice in eateries The spring rolls are made with rice paper and such an array of fresh bite sized vegetables it melts in your mouth and there are so many different kinds ave price Did I say they are HUGE It s a weight watchers dream Everything on the menu that we have tried has been delicious and presented beautifully The sauces accompanying each dish are always intrigueing and tasty as all get out The best thing of all though is the Ginger Creme Brule Wow sir It doesnt get better than that If you like Viet food Thai food or just plain fresh good food then this Vietnamese restaraunt should pique your interest My goal is to try everything on the menu So my friends and I had to roll each other out of the door after this meal was over but it was sooooooooo worth it BEST red kool aid ever served in jars BEST waffles I ve EVER had BEST red velvet cake I ve EVER had I also did enjoy their chicken mac cheese and collard greens but none were the best I ve ever had but very good I seriously dream about their waffles and red velvet cake I don t know what magic mix of ingredients make up the waffle batter but it s absolutely perfect and these waffles would stand deliciously on their own even without butter and syrup but who d want to do that the red velvet slice they give you is HUGE and soooo moist the frostings is cream cheesy delicousness I can not wait to indulge in this treat again but since I m far from being the only one who loves this place it is always packed and the wait is long at least on the weekend Seriously considering taking a day off of work just for a weekday Lo Lo s run P This was the marriage of two of my favorite things alcohol and ice cream As Charlie Sheen would say Winning I had a groupon so Laura A and I went to try out this amazing place The groupon got us each two scoops so we went with different so we could sample the most possible I got the Apple Pie Spiced Rum and Black Raspberry Chambord Liqueur Both were awesome I actually enjoyed the Chambord the most but I was in ice cream heaven Laura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita Tequila I really enjoyed both of her s the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about am on a Saturday just sayin I have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and can t wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didn t see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great I hope that eventually I can find a pinapple upside down cake with rum flavor What can I say about Execucar I love their service It cost just as much if not cheaper than taking a cab for me I make a reservation on line get confirmation via email as well as a phone call the day before confirming my reservation The cars are always nice clean and fresh smelling yes that may seem weird but I have been in some cabs that were like WHOA The drivers are always in shirts ties and slacks and they are professional and courteous I have never had a driver be late knock on wood and they have always gotten me to the airport on time Plus I get some frequent flyer miles added to my USAirways account for using them Can we say bonus I LOVE this bar My first visit was in when it was known as Bar Nun I d just moved to AZ and I was drawn in by the neon green light and funny name Little did I know it was the beginning of a love affair Since I didn t know anyone yet I went by myself and sat at the bar The staff was friendly and so were the patrons Some of the patrons turned out to be a little too friendly and the bartender Jennifer insisted that the barback walk me to my car to ensure my safety As if that wasn t enough to make a fan out of me I found out they serve Blue Moons all day Saturday and the food is awesome The burgers are great and you can order them rare if you like I also became addicted to their BBQ chicken sandwich And the wings They ll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus In fact I don t thing there is anything that I have tried and disliked here Thursday Sunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band Usually classic rock or s stuff They also have NTN and a ton of TVs if you re into sports I was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment I made sure my new house was within walking distance Not that you d need to walk since half the year it is hot as hell even at am I can see why you wouldn t want to walk they offer a free ride program on the weekends where they ll pick you up and drop you off That way you don t have to worry about Sheriff Joe and wearing pink undies at Tent City Wow I kinda wanna move back now CK s I miss you Thank God there were some Mesa firemen standing outside this place when I pulled up as my wife was very uneasy about exiting our car and heading in Even trying to explain how fellow Yelpers loved it did not ease her fears After a unanimous Defnitely it s awesome amongst the three battlers of the flame in response to my Is this place worth going to we parked the car and walked on in This place is a definite hole in the wall read DUMP and I we LOVED it Great chicken tacos awesome machaca shredded beef burros delicious chorizo and the tamales were equally spectacular homemade of course It s located in a somewhat dicey area of Phoenix due west of the airport but it s totally worth going to It has become my new first stop after I get off the plane at Sky Harbor unless I land too late at night I ve been a patient of PFD for a few years recommended by a friend and have always been happy with the attention I ve gotten I actually go to the Gilbert location now but I have been to the Tempe office once and had a good experience there It s a family owned business I think they ve been around for years They have always been pleasant and honest when talking teeth I wanted to mention my hygienist specifically Jackie She is super nice calm and gentle which is important to me since I don t particularly like going to the dentist Check them out if you re in the market for a dentist Great Great Great salon They offer all sorts of services and Karyn one of the nail techs is amazing I m a little obsessive with perfection when it comes to my nails and she does an absolute perfect job Pays so much attention to detail She is always creative and can make designs if you wish She has many many color options I would recommend EVERYONE to her and this salon Plus they won Best Salon in the East Valley The grooming salon at this location does an amazing job with pets Yesterday was the nd time my baby was groomed here by Chip I hope I spelled his name correctly he s just wonderful He s very patient and very kind with my Sushi poo and I m comfortable leaving him in Chip s hands Best Subway anywhere Super friendly staff and always really clean I really adore this place They ve got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very very juicy I recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork Their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly Last time I was in I noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the park and ride light rail station right in front of their restaurant Do yourself the favor If you re heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike stop off here and enjoy a nice meal They have good lunch specials around for a full plate with meat hummus garlic sauce pita and tabouli Mmmm I think Mr Goodcents has the best subs in town I have no idea why people go to Subway Goodcents slices the meat and cheese when you order your sandwich and their bread is baked fresh you can t beat it Get oil and vinegar on your sandwich and the taste is to die for The staff was very friendly and oftentimes the owners are there working footlongs are there too only they taste x s better They re all over the city if this one isn t in your neck of the woods I discovered this place by going on one of my usual mile bike rides along the canal until something cool popped up I sat outside and sipped a nice chamomile tea as the first rain of winter fell unleashing an amazing scent The staff was top notch and I was delighted to see several tannat wines from Uruguay on the menu I can t wait to return some evening to share a bottle of wine and tapas with my girlfriend When I was a dancer I always came here for everything Shoes leotards skirts and accessories They have every type of dance shoe and a wide variety of everything dancers need and want I m not sure how many dance shops are in the area but all of my instructors always recommended this place which is not very close to our studio The staff is all very kind and knowledgeable which trust me is a very good thing Dance shoes can get confusing There are at least three different kind of tap shoes Dee s also has costume rentals so if you ever need a crazy costume at the last minute Dee s can help you out with that too When my youngest son graduated I took him to Buzz Boys when they were in the Food City complex He is now and still goes I gave a family friend a gift certificate for Fathers day He still goes and so does his yr old son My oldest son is out of the Army and he started going These men compare this to a spa for men Hot towels straight razor shave etc Hey I should get commission lol I heart Rome s Pizza Being a native New Yorker I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza I had tried many local independent places but no one got it right When I moved back to Scottsdale about months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road I figured we could try it out I m always on the look out for some yummy pizza Don t be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior after all isn t it what s inside that counts The food is always fresh The Greek salad is great it comes in small and large The pizza is amazing as long as you know what you re getting NY style I know that it s family owned which I always have an appreciation for The man that owns it does most of the deliveries When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldn t find my street Embarrassingly I only knew the street I lived on and not much more so I couldn t help him He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude thinking I m an idiot because I didn t know where I lived could you really blame him But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem How refreshing In a nutshell hoooorray for Rome s A small bite goes a long way I first was introduced to these brownies in when I received a variety box with sprites and a can of cocoa for Christmas I love the packaging the deep purple and brown on the box and wrapper After devouring my first brownie I was an instant fan The card in the box said you can freeze the brownies for up to a month but it was gone within the week The can of cocoa lasted for a good months I used it for baking cookies breads cakes etc My faves Cream Cheese Espresso Nib Toffee Crunch and Caramel The sprites are just the perfect size because it s just enough to get your chocolate fix but not overwhelming I just throw one in my purse before I leave the house and I can have it with my coffee in the afternoon I m a subscriber of their email so I ve been receiving emails with discount codes and free shipping It s so hard to resist Lucky me I stumbled on a Groupon several months ago and I got a box of Sprite for almost half the price plus shipping The oatmeal cookie frozen yogurt here is amazing The place is small but accomodating enough to get your yogurt and find a seat It s similar to Yogurtini and the other places like this Last time I came here I saw a guy with the most awesome s blonde mullet I have ever laid eyes on Rock on Andrea has been a lifesaver literally She was watching over our furry monsters when our AC went out in July and we were across the country She not only made an extra visit just to see if the AC was broken but helped us find an open kennel to get our cats boarded She s been our creature sitter several times now thankfully with less craziness Her rates are very reasonable and she keeps in great contact with you Her initial visit with us went over all the little things we wanted done like picking up the paper and bringing it in and was very thorough Since she offers a full house sitter and pet sitter menu of services she s knows things to cover that we had not thought of She s very professional and is licensed and insured Your animals will thank you Went here for a work function today What can I say this place is awesome A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet yum Nice salad bar with good variety as well instead of bacon bits they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries mmm Simply awesome stuff Taking the wife when I can I have been coming here since and the food just keeps on getting better The jerk fried rice and emerald chicken are to die for and he snicker doodle cookies oh my goodness Every time I m in phoenix this is my must go see do eat spot The owner Frank is awesome Oh how I miss this Goodwill store which opened in September I moved to North Carolina in March and have not been able to find anything like it here Large clean and very well organized this store is thrift shop heaven And it s all for a good cause there s a job center right on site that helps people find work Go on Thursdays if you can when a designated tag color is just I ve purchased a lot of name brand clothing here for per piece You can also check out certain Saturdays when everything in the store is half price I got a great mirror that matched the dresser in my guest bedroom for This place is so good I would not be writing this review if I still lived in Arizona because I would want to keep all the bargains to myself hamburgessa heaven Guac and bacon on a burger is ingenious I do wish they had some curly fries or something but the burgers cant be beat Also the condiment BAR is brilliant FILLY B s only reviews NINE now wow do i miss THIS place hrs drive thru or walk up only ridiculously cheap ridiculously tasty of course the arizona burritos are good everything is good i used to LOVE one of the combos you get a beef burrito taco rice and beans for UNDER wow color me silly and call me sally they have bomb horchata too really good and fresh flautas rolled tacos and breakfast burritos damn everything here is good whether drunk or sober If you haven t been to this place go Seriously It s amazing It s the best little hole in a rundown strip mall you can find And it s cheap Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting this tiny place is hidden in the corner The owner is from El Salvador so don t expect it to be Mexican food there are many similarities but the dishes themselves are different Walking in you can smell the homemade pupusas seriously it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America It s amazing There are only a couple waitresses and I don t think they speak much English but the menu is in pictures as well as in Spanish and some English so you should do just fine Get the pupusas they re like thick hand made tortillas stuffed with either pork cheese and beans or my favorite cheese and loraco flower which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus to me It s definitely the best one These things come with salsa and some coleslaw if they don t just ask for the salsa and are very filling The other dishes are really good too For a low price you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans and this place doesn t skimp on the fixin s They put slices of fresh tomatoes avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates I honestly LOVE it here If you want to avoid the crowds come at an off hour then you can just sit relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner For dessert pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register I can t recommend this place enough Very friendly staff or a fast food place their customer service and friendliness is unmatched I go more often than not simply because of the experience every time Thanks Micky First time eating Chicken and waffles and it was the best time ever What a beautiful facility Attention to detail is what this place is about and the army of workers each takes his her portion of the details and does a mighty fine job If you want a high end place to stay This is a good choice When I made my hotwire reservation and ended up here I got the deal of the century I am sure the rack rate is high but if you want comfort and great facility this would be a wonderful choice Oh yes Everyone and I mean everyone was soooo nice The gardeners the cleaning staff the front desk the parking attendant all of them were super nice and fun and genuinely happy to be of service The best Chinese food I have had since leavong Chinatown in California The crab puffs had crab not Krab and were much more crab than puff The food was cooked perfectly and delicious I strongly recommend the Mu Shu Pork I love this place I especially love it on Tuesdays when it s free I have been to many lectures openings and films at the Museum and am always fascinated The changing photography exhibit is always fantastic The fashion room is one of my favorite features BUT my favorite piece is the firefly installation I could seriously live in that room I take everyone I know and everyone is always as mesmerized as I am and I have seen it many times I love the new contemporary wing of the museum I also love the glass boxes on the sides of the building One time we were there during a thunderstorm and sat in the glass box and watched the lightening It was perfect The museum always makes me happy Don t usually give stars but this is good sushi At first I was a little skeptic of all the macadamia nuts on their sushi but it is a great compliment The rolls are original and all very good The Climax s and the Elliot are my favorite Words cannot express how much I love the meat shop I love it like a fat guy loves the place that sells him the best bacon he has ever had because I am and it is I ll be honest it can be a bit intimidating walking in to the Meat Shop for the first time if you aren t a chef and don t know your cuts you may be afraid but don t fear just ask for help because the staff are excellent Whether beef pork or lamb the meat here is always the best quality and knowing its locally raised and by people who care about what they are doing makes it even better And price I ve never compared closely but I don t really think twice about the price here Be warned If you buy meat here you will be ruined You will never again be able to purchase that saltwater packed antibiotic injected hormonally treated ammonia and pink good filled crap in your supermarket again And that is a very very good thing I LOL just thinking about some of the cast members and skits that I have seen at Jesterz The first time I saw Jesterz I was expecting it to be pretty awkward and honeslty didn t know what to expect I was blown away how funny it got at times Good clean funny We went again soon after the first time but didn t go again for a good years we went back recently and was kinda worried as the crowd was not as big as past times Even with a smaller crowd there were tons of LOL moments Writing about it kinda makes me want to go back Just a quick update Took my parents here for lunch today and now I have more converts If anyone is still sleeping on this place shame on you you re really missing out Why DELICIOUS food made from QUALITY ingredients and FRESHLY prepared hot to order Good stuff all around Stopped back in here today for lunch with Arlin B Robyn N Mike C They re still delivering the same upscale Asian Buffet experience here as before including atmosphere food table service that are just tops so it s Woohoo again for this excellent restaurant See previous review for more details Weekday Lunch Buffet is still Sr I had a great burger experience here and intend to return the next time I am craving a Fuddburger I also got to introduce a friend to Fuddrucker s for the first time so it was a cherry poppin adventure Not only are the burgers here tasty but I love the fact that you get to pick and choose the toppings from their self serve produce and condiment bars One of my favorite things on french fries is Heinz sauce and Fuddrucker s is truly awesome for including that amongst its vast condiment selection As a professed condiment whore I was thrilled to discover a new flavor of Tabasco I have never encountered before and I like to think I really know my Tabasco products having lived in Louisiana for years This Fuddruckers special orders the Sweet Spicy variety of Tabasco which is not only great on a burger but would work as an egg roll dipping sauce Knowing that I must have it for home use my dining partner graciously approached the manager who arranged to allow him to purchase a bottle This was just one example of how efficient helpful and friendly the staff here are Next visit I will demand to meet the one who refers to himself only as Mr Crusty Baker see photos The restaurant also has a lot of shiny fun decor evoking shameless Americana and Route roadside culture The bright colors and the overindulgence in fast food goodness contributes to a heightened state of arousal that can only be described as a Burger Party Contact High You can just feel the burger love the afterglow punctuated by the difficult click of the seat belt as you strap in for a ride back to a somber less gluttonous reality True fine dining has come to the Valley If you are looking to have a special dinner this is the place And plan on spending hours as it is a true culinary experience The tasting menu consists of options of or courses and they can be paired with wine if you like This is the way to go and even for tasting portions they are not micro mini The choices for each course are extensive At least each AND the coolest part is that you won t find any ingredient repeated twice NONE Yes you might find tomatoes in the same night but they won t be the same type That s not easy to pull off considering the variety of the menu But while you are between courses Chef Binkley will send out numerous amuse bouche which if you don t know are tiny little one bit or one gulp appetizers like mini sliders the size of a half dollar or pancetta mousse in a shot glass We ate there for my ex H s bday and had amuse bouche Also if you let them know in advance you are there for a special occasion you will get custom printed menus for everyone at the table mentioning the special event The ONLY drawback is the atmosphere It definitely doesn t fit the quality and beauty of the food But I still give it a as the food is superb If you are a true foodie GO I was excited the whole meal as I couldn t wait to see what came out next If you are a meat and potatoes type with an uneducated palate save your time and money since you won t appreciate the menu at all Lives up to the local fuss Quick cheap tasty and one of the few fast Mexican food restaurants that utilize yellow cheese which is my cardinal rule of good Mexican food Love their pizza Very fresh Their cannoli was really good too They seem to have great selection of wines Beaver Choice is an excellent place which I have had the chance to visit three or four times This is about as home cooked as you can get in a restaurant It s like eating at Mom s house if Mom happens to be Swedish I ve had a few of the entrees schnitzel cordon bleu pork medallions seared gravlax and all were delicious Especially the gravlax The sides are also great and you usually get three per meal The poutine is perhaps not as good as what you d get in Quebec but it s easily the best I ve had in Arizona The fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points I have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty the Beaver Supreme This mess of chocolate meringue cream mandarin orange and possibly a few other things is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting but ultimately find your free will diminished invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes Also it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap I just have to ask why would anyone go to a Scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap Can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a Viking camp and order a chicken wrap Your head would be off before you could recite one measly Odinian incantation Always a healthy fresh meal One of my favorites is the hummus and grilled chicken appetizer which is gynormous and I have them add in some tabbouleh then cucumbers on the side Perfection All the pitas and the seasonal specials are always super good Wine is also inexpensive if the mood strikes Otherwise great casual lunch and dinner spot that is extremely reasonable in price for the quality of food you are getting There is something for everyone here veggies kids etc If I ever moved from AZ this is the first place I would come visit upon my return Parking can get hairy at the Arcadia location and one time someone actually backed into my car when I was legally parked along a curb but that is hardly Pita Jungle s fault The douche didn t even leave a note but I digress and karma is real and nothing would keep me from coming back to Pita I love everything at Market bistro but I especially love the salads I always get the create your own with their homemade and delicious buttermilk Caesar dressing on the side That dressing is totally addictive The other thing I would wholeheartedly recommend is the Market pizza with goat cheese artichoke hearts oven roasted tomato baby spinach mozzarella parmesan and basil pesto sauce It is probably my favorite vegetarian pizza You can get it by the slice at lunch but have to order a whole pizza for dinner I ve had the corn chowder with poblano chiles soup and it was great I ve not tried the roasted garlic tomato soup but my friend loves it Had a sandwich here once with tri tip with caramelized onions but it doesn t seem to match the description of the ones currently on the menu The only thing I haven t loved so far is their Margherita pizza Everyone here is always nice and friendly I love that it s family owned and still doing well enough to open another location They now have online ordering which I can t wait to try What a great way to spend Easter morning After taking part in the egg hunt on the main grounds and BTW they know how to do it here Massive dumps of eggs full of goodies More than the kids could carry Plenty of photo ops Parents who weren t acting out scenes from Soylent Green we made our way to this nicely upscale coffee shop casual dining spot We were seated minutes ahead of our reservation keeping my little guy from popping a gasket I chose the breakfast buffet and considering it included a custom made omelette with organic ingredients as well as juice and coffee it was a steal Service was wonderful and the staff was sure to make us feel at home Well actually better than home because I don t have people looking after my every whim and need while at home stars Definitely Upon walking in everything from the atmosphere decor and staff was warm and inviting We each ordered a course meal and agreed on different selections The addition of a homemade mozzarella appetizer and an amazing dessert meant we each tasted dishes that night amazingly unique and delicious dishes We tasted from every section of their menu including raw butterfish and albacore cooked gnocchi and risotto and meat short rib and pork belly Pretty much everything was my favorite and a couple of glasses of Barbara complemented the meal perfectly It was pretty quiet on the night we visited if I may make a suggestion it would be to GO GO GO to Crudo Like now Very yummy my favorite roll is the Las vegas and here they make a good one and it s off during happy hour I keep meaning to come for the all you can eat sushi Try the Ice Cream sushi roll this is one of the only places I know that does it and it is delicious Scale of multiple visits Food Service Atmosphere Value Thanks for helping me to find Valley Eyecare Center fellow Yelpers I visited their office as a new patient and knew from the moment I walked in that it was going to be a positive experience The receptionist was friendly the office was modern and clean and the wait was super short mins I was impressed with care that was provided and didn t feel rushed when working with Dr Eric Clyde or his assistant The three words that come to mind when thinking of this office are professional prompt and accurate My visit was for a contact lens fitting so no comment on their frame selection service When we first got here I felt disappointed until I realized the zoo is much larger than it first appears Particularly worthy of checking out the lions and tigers Also do not pass up the monkey walk The little squirrel monkeys are fun to watch Be sure to shell out the extra bucks to feed the giraffes It s a unique experience to be so close to these large yet gentle creatures Definitely my favorite part of my visit Visit Date Okay this just might sum it up I LOVE YOGURTLAND WITH ALL OF MY HEART Go get some yogurt the end No but seriously do go All of these yogurt places have been popping up everywhere the past couple years and when Mojo opened up at the Biltmore I loved it but it was far away Then yogurtland opened up right next to where I live and i discovered it WAS BETTER Sooo many flavors and they change a few of them out every once in awhile They have all the normal yogurt toppings plus white chocolate sauce chocolate sauce and caramel sauce Hello Isn t this supposed to be healthy Haha it actually is if you take advantage of their freshly cut fruit I just love it I took my brother and he is the first person I ve seen to grab the biggest cup they have I asked him why and he said It s so good I can take some home and put it in the freezer for later My favorite is pistachio yogurt with gummie bears Record is times in one week message me if you ve beat that This is one of my new favorites places to bring people who are from out of town It s something different that I think real Foodies will enjoy Although the restaurant itself is dark and cramped it s worth going to over and over again I ordered the Shepherd s Pie Pasty it was very filling and delicious Although I had to wait minutes for it it was worth waiting for a fresh out of the oven pasty But if you re ever in a rush a good thing about this place is that you can call ahead and request for them to start cooking your pasty so that it is ready to be served once you arrive I love this place sure its kinda creepy and in the middle of an odd office complex but DAMN those donut holes chocolate cake not the glazed ones are good Not to mention the NINJA BOWLS Good God get the Sizzling ninja top that off with a fried egg and pineapple get healthy with some brown rice and white chicken and then DRENCH that bowl with NINJA SAUCE AND SRIRACHA which comes standard btw AMAZING Don t waste your life away without having one of these ninja bowls at this donut shop i never thought i would be able to say that statement with a straight face but i did And for those wondering they don t serve pirates some will understand this fact Also if you come back a few times they might throw some free donut holes at YOUR FACE LIKE NINJA STARS I joke they don t throw them but you may get some for free really though I have eaten here several times before and I don t think I have ever left upset I ve always enjoyed my meals but this time I can honestly say that I enjoyed all of my courses I was with a group of four other girls We all started off with the amuse It was some sort of sous vide duck on toast It was really good Next we had our choice out of four starters I along with three other girls had the sauteed scallop So beautiful Four out of five of us ordered the beef tenderloin It melted in my mouth It was perfectly cooked The only bad thing is that I wanted more Finally you get to chose from four desserts I don t like sweets so I always bring it home to the kids But they are so beautiful Now for the price my meal was only for everything It doesn t get any better than that I also ordered the orangecello for an extra Well worth it Only sad part is that we were the only table there Makes me sad Everyone is missing out Our server also took us on a tour of the school afterwards The best Gelato ever EVER Yeah I said it What Seriously the best customer service I ve experienced since the s By the time I ordered I was nearly full because they encourage customers to try everything easily different favors to sample and choose from My favorites are the dark chocolate salted caramel peach champagne and black cherry We ve visited multiple times and have never been disappointed same quality service and deliciousness every time My kids referred them to a friend and he owner gave my kids free gelato on their next visit they appreciate their customers If your looking for your next vice check this place out Still a great place to eat A little further from Los Tacos in AJ home for me since Los Tacos closed i frequent here more often It is good I want to add that their green corn tamales are GREAT their Green sauce seems to be a popular choice here on YELP s reviews I like it a lot too I plan to order more tamales for the holidays hurrah had a cap steak for the first time Best steak i have ever had Would recommend to anyone this place is amazing So many flavors to choose from I LOVE this place ADORABLE PLACE Wraps Pastas Salads Pizza Gelato Pastries Sodas and Such Super darling place that makes you feel so comfortable Looks like they have computers to use i don t know if there is a charge The inside is precious decorated to the T not a single spot was missed Our food was placed on a silver tray and handed over to us to sit in a comfy booth and enjoy our wraps and pizza It was really good The place is just so darn adorable it s hard to concentrate on the food when everything was so POSH while you NOSH Get it Food great Service Excellent I had the Frank Sinatra Calzone you choose items for the filling I suggest what I had sausage pepperoni and meatball It was just like being back in New York Loaded with Ricotta too They don t skimp here The server was great too Didn t catch his name but he s a burly bald headed guy with a beard Very friendly polite attentive Cool to look in the kitchen and see the pizzas being hand tossed Wonder if the cook thinks I was looking at him Well I actually was but only because he really got into tossing the pizzas and was entertaining to watch Go there Eat everything Tip big This is the largest urban park Moreover that urban part is great because I am minutes from three major trailhead areas For hiking I like many points of entry one of my favorites is telegraph pass this is on the south side of the mountain A new recently remolded parking lot is found on desert foothills parkway There is a paved path that is about a mile and at its end Telegraph pass is to the left and Desert classic is to the right Telegraph pass grows in steepness towards the top where there are some larger stairs At the top there is a bench and you can then continue on National trail If you head west you can reach a great Ramada From the pima canyon entrance I take the fire road to national after the initial ascent it is just some rolling hills I then make left to hidden valley where there is a great natural tunnel Follow this trail to reach fat man s pass contrary to the name there is a narrow gap that fat men cannot pass luckily you can go around this meets back up with national trail Many unique rock formations on this hike For shorter easier hikes from this lot you can do the east and west loops and Beverly canyon all small trails that loop and have a few nice views For Mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so I stick to the east end of desert classic with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines it s great for a novice rider Tweet tweet I decided to follow Market Bistro on Twitter just recently and am sure glad I did This company really knows how to treat their followers I have been a fan of Market Bistro for years now they have such a comfortable setting at both locations and the food is impeccable not to mention reasonably priced I have always opted for the Market pizza a dish that includes artichokes large sundried tomatoes and a flat parmesean encrusted dough There hasn t been one time that I ve visited Market and felt disappointed in portion size or my order I have such an appreciation for an establishment that takes pride in their food s ingredients atmosphere and customer service methods As for salads If you can take the heat I would absolutely recommend the Arizona Salad The chipotle dressing black beans rice and tortilla crisps are a terrific blend of taste for your palette You will feel right at home here in the southwest with each and every bite If you haven t already started your car or phoned in your order at Market I m sure you are crazy BRAVO hashtagging seems appropriate here As good as all the others and closer to home than most Is there a way I can give LUSH an extra star Pros Friendly enthusiastic staff incredible products lots of samples phenomenal smells reasonable prices and get this an HONEST company Read their bag it ll make you love them more Cons if you re sensitive to smells brace yourself Also if you re the type that wants to be left alone while you shop beware The staff is excited about their products Don t miss R B hair moisturizer it drives men crazy Coalface facial cleanser Brazen Honey exfoliating mask Even for meat eaters Green has a lot to love A lot more than just tofu I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it s spectacular of the time A few of our favorite items are the BBQ Chicken sandwich Thee Argentine sandwich the crab puffs and of course the Tsoynamis Everything is fairly priced for a sandwich for a bowl w your choice or rice or noodles The only thing I don t particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty The ranch that it comes with is fantastic though Also if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese Daiya tastes much better in my opinion The atmosphere is very artsy There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy There is free wifi a booshelf will all sorts of great reading and the staff is always super friendly Another great thing about Green is the vegan market They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with It s the only place I know of where you can find Teese Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls As an aside I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food veganized Turkey stuffing biscuits brussels sprouts asparagus cranberry sauce gravy corn pie and a drink You ll get guest speakers live music and local arts and crafts Highly recommend I go to Pro s Ranch Market often for lunch sometimes several times a week I ve had the street tacos chile relleno burritos and some other tasty treats I m a huge fan of the agua fresca stand my favorites are the strawberry pineapple and horchata And the bakery oh the bakery They have everything sweet you could want including individual servings of flan and tres leches cake The store itself has the cheapest produce in town a giant meat counter and a great assortment of cheeses Ranch Market also has super delicious tortilla chips and salsas This is one of my favorite places to go if I m on my way to a BBQ or party there are so many options i know i know this gelato is a bit on the pricier side especially when you consider that phoenix now has a bajillion gelato shops that each offer a million and one flavors for a few washingtons HOWEVER arlecchino is definitely the BEST it s worth theprice worth the drive and worth the parking hassle the owners are super nice and accommodating and although there is a sample limit the workers have never said no more the flavors are classic inventive fresh and authentic plus it s such a cute tiny little hole in the wall shoppe that you can t help but love it in all it s quaint glory Elmer I love you I have since I was a senior at Chandler High Back then I was broke so I could only get a bean burrito and strips and they were dang good If anyone wants to complain about strips just being chips and cheese they can suck it Now days I am a little less broke so I always get the green chili burro And it is always so good Spicy enough to burn a little and the tortilla is always fresh thanks man And bless your little Mexican Heart you serve corn dogs so I can even come here with my crazy picky kids I love you Elmer I always will Wow this place is still here I went there as a girl years ago with the family on a regular basis If it s still around then it MUST be good Rarely give a but truthfully We set out to go to Giuseppes and stopped here thought we were there I m sure Giu is good but Arrivederci is the bomb We will keep going on every visit Reasonable and really really authentic Bueno Sera is your welcome and they mean it We loved it reasonable too b I can only vouch for the chicken salad as it s the only thing I ve ever tried in the years I ve been coming here It s THAT good I always think about trying something else but why mess with perfection Walking inside gives you the sense that you ve stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late s I personally find it to be awesome Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare And yes the late s is historic by Scottsdale standards Besides whatever money they re not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad Put it in the baby book Baby s first AJ s And you ll always have a special soft place in your heart for your first I love that while this location is in a nice part of town it s not quite the same level of frou frou as many other spots That means rather than dealing with the Scottsdale types who have to dress up to go to the store you re dealing with a greater range of folks but they are all willing to pay a bit more for the good stuff I will say you ll pay less for a box of cereal or box of triscuits at a Circle K than you will at an AJ s And I don t think I ve ever seen anything on sale But there is just nothing like their fresh food Be it produce or the meat section the colors are brighter the items are bigger and you just know it s going to taste better Their chicken breasts and pork chops are so amazingly good and so large you want to eat them all at once but you just can t You have to try some of their pre prepped meats My fav is a pork loin with apple stuffing Wow And of course great pre made foods too if you just want to pick up something to go I ve been suckered in to their desert section far too many times And they are always good But dang they can be pricy so it really has to just be a special splurge If you haven t tried an AJ s yet I suggest this one to ease you into things There may be quite a few Lexus in the parking lot but there won t be too many Hummers Hip hop sandwich shop Not a traditional dining experience Food was great and prices were very great Everything on menu was under Mac and Cheese is worth ordering as an appetizer and the BLT was rediculously delicious I look forward to going back again and probably again We saw a small door with a sign over it and were intrigued so we went inside that s how we found Kazimierz Once our eyes adjusted it s dark inside like any good speakeasy I loved the decor It s a wine bar with food that seems to be Egyptian flatbreads and then whatever the chef wants to make We were there on a Saturday right in the middle of happy hour and enjoyed a ridiculous evening of items that were mostly Wine flights flatbreads certain bottles of wine BOTTLES OF WINE I m sure they were just cleaning out old inventory since they have hundreds of listings but for these two wines until they ran out of bottles the bottles were We had the Northern Territory flatbread pancetta yukon gold potatoes rosemary cr me fra che and smoked gouda Yum We also had an open faced sandwich made with smoked pork belly apple butter and melted cheese with sweet potato chips on the side IT WAS Between the bottle of wine and that I felt like I was stealing from these people The bartenders were great as so was the music I will without question be going back This place is a lil bit of awesomeness The food was great the service was awesome and the atmosphere was very nice What s not to like about a great steakhouse that serves great food and provides awesome service I can t believe some of the things I ve been seeing people NAG about in their reviews for this new restaurant I set my standards pretty high for Rice Paper and they did not disappoint I took my wife on a date here last night because she really loves beef pho and had been waiting for this place to open up The atmosphere was very bright and welcoming as well was our server He sat down with us and quickly went over what was good and what was popular with most patrons so far We took him up on a few of his suggestions and started with the fried calamari I m not sure what they bread it with but it was delicious and the squid was perfect not too soft not too chewy For our main course I ordered the Shaking Beef which was cubed filet mignon served over onions on a sizzling platter in a special sauce with a side of rice and grilled zuchinni again on the suggestion of my server I HIGHLY RECOMMEND My wife got the beef pho at first I was a bit iffy on it because the broth looked very clear as if it were going to be somewhat watery but it was VERY well seasoned Our server told us that the broth stews for at least hours allowing it to achieve the best flavor from the pho spices VERY IMPRESSED Yes it is much pricier than your average pho joint but I d rather pay a bit extra for a nice clean and slightly upscale atmosphere And the quality of the food is MUCH higher than the mystery meat you ll get in your bowl of pho at some other places Well done Rice Paper we WILL be back Been here times in the past months I love bringing out of towners here Excellent art and history exhibits specifically related to Native Americans from the southwestern United States Reasonably priced entrance fee Go on the tour they will tell you really interesting things about each of the exhibits you otherwise wouldn t know makes the visit much more enjoyable A must see for visitors to Phoenix It isn t often enough that I get to dine at Carlsbad but last night I decided to have dinner there I ll be completely honest service is always a mixed bag But then you figure when they re crammed to the gills which is generally how it goes you can t always expect Speedy freaking Gonzales to be your server However last night I don t think I could have sneezed between the time I ordered my food and when it arrived to my table Excellent is all I can say about this joint If you re looking for some tasty New Mexican fare get over there And if it s packed let the valet park your car CUZ ITS FREE Start off with a Dos Equis Amber get some nachos this vegetarian WILL eat the niblets of chicken in them nachos cuz it s just that tasty and kick back Preferably on the patio because there s a waterfall And if Jacob s working the bar expect nothing but the best in cocktails seriously Arai pastry is so delicious ironically i come here not for the sweeties confections cakes cookies cremes not being my style but for their delicious savory treats The breads they make here are top knotch the various salty pastries are all worth exploring the red bean one and the curry filled ones being my favorites But the real deal the Coup de gr ce the mamoth reason of what makes this little japanese pastry shop in my mind is their sandwhiches green tea shakes that powerful one two punch of savory sagacity is what makes me want to live sometimes yes yes i find the world to be a better place with those items in my tummy My trip was inspired by Adam Richmond s visit and while I couldn t do the slider challenge I knocked out and was close to taking on a th The GM stopped by to check on us and the waitress was great Be sure to grab some fresh baked deli treats before heading out I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii Everytime I come home our first stop is Wongs I love everything about it Wongs is my comfort food My brother from San Francisco was in town and missing the sushi from the bay area I decided I d let him choose where we d go out even though I d never ever heard of this place before It was definitely in a not so glamorous area tucked on the side of a dinky shopping center sorry shopping center When we walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the quaint atmosphere and set up It s definitely small but everyone working there and eating there seemed to be genuinely having a great time We sat at the bar long table in front of the sushi chefs which was a fun experience We started off with sake and it was pretty darn smooth We ordered a variety of different dishes including sea urchin eggs yellowtail shashimi and the king crab roll They were even accomodating to make my brother dishes that weren t on the menu The chefs are so nice and fun and the prices are pretty good My brother was extremely impressed coming from a top sushi city I look forward to coming back and trying more of their extensive menu especially for happy hour First I m sorry this review is lengthy but i really want people to understand how far a little kindness can go I entered Mimi s Cafe at the end of possibly worst day ever I came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out i waited not seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named Danielle She gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before i looked at the menu for some time unable to clear my mind enough to decide She told me i was welcome to take a seat and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley where s the fire take your time can i get you a glass of wine while you decide wine was a perfect idea I finally ordered and sat drinking my wine i waited and then waited a little longer Danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine When she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news Somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help It was just the olive branch i needed Just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion finally my food was ready She boxed everything with care for the drive home All this time smiling i couldn t help but notice Danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange She had brightened my day and it was clear she is a light for others in Mimi s Cafe This is the kicker my bill was and some change i gave her what i thought was two dollar bills but in reality was a and a The young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir I m not sure these bills are right i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no i thought they were two s but the difference would be her reward for honesty The food was tasty and just what i needed Mimi s Cafe is a friendly place worth the wait for food or a table and if Mimi s Cafe reads these reviews know that you have a superstar in Danielle This is quite literally the best burger I have ever eaten The rocket bacon cheeseburger with patties of meat on a in sesame sub roll and is nothing short of amazing It could easily be shared The cheese fries and onion rings are homemade We love the casual environment and the huge selection of glass bottled soda To top it off the prices are amazing This is our first time here but we are hooked We would love to see this place on Diners Drive In s and Dives DDDinfo mac com so if you love it here nominate it A real gem We went on a Friday night and even though it is off season here the place was packed Never the less the service was impeccable as always This is our third trip here and we have never been disappointed I had the Oz NY strip and my wife had the prime rib Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned ever so wonderfully My wife tells me the horseradish is the real deal and not the runny stuff you get elsewhere can t vouch as I hate the stuff From the bread to the desert every bite was worth taking The old time ambiance with the dark wood and red leather booths are welcoming It s pricey and if you can ignore the geek with khakis no socks and deck shoes ever so gently cradling his wine you KNOW the guy and he is everywhere in the middle of a Phoenix summer it is worth every single cent SOOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN The of us went to Superstition Farm for their tour last Saturday No we didn t have any kids with us but we may have had a better time than most of the kids The beginning is a bit dry You re in the classroom for a while learning about random facts related to diary cows Moo After that it s a hay ride Girls let me give you one tip Make sure you wear long pants or shorts that are long Hay is very uncomfortable under your butt if there isn t enough padding Anyway the hay ride was entertaining but the best part had yet to come Once the hayride was over the tour was officially over But everyone stuck around to check out the petting zoo The animals were all so friendly and we got to feed them as well There was a hodgepodge of creatures from a young cow to sheep to rabbits and even a turkey Yum just kidding In addition there s a black lab on the premise that was amazing This dog would make an incredible soccer player His reaction time is unbelievable any team would be happy to have him as a goalie After the animal bonding we went to try flavored milk Mine was butterscotch flavored and it was just ok I was disappointed that the milk wasn t fresh from the farm but I guess it s not legal to serve unprocessed milk Since we had a Groupon we also had a chance to try Udder Delights ice cream At each I would never pay for them individually But seeing that it was included in my deal we enjoyed them a lot Don t be embarrassed if you don t have kids Trust me adults can enjoy Superstition Farm too They get stars for the only thing I have ever had there Every single time I have to get the Pizza Nortena It is out of this world It is meant to be an appetizer but we get it to go and have it for dinner THis place is great I need an adjustment every now and then but I live in Scottsdale and my regular Chiropractor is so good that he is always booked up ahead of time so if I tweek my back unexpectedly I can t get in soon enough quite often So now I have a place to go seven days a week that is every bit as good as my normal Chiro I have only gone to the weekend chiro but my wife and one of my employees have seen Dr Brian and they love him So if you need a good Chiro go see these guys any day of the week Try em you ll love em OK Where do I start This place is AMAZING I love the food here especially the fact that you can eat and watch a movie at the same time Forget about the movie theater popcorn you can get a rack of ribs here while enjoying your movie Before the movie starts a waiter walks around with an iPod touch taking your order usually during the previews During the movie you can press the Service Light to add more things to your order About nearing the end of the movie you will get your check so make sure that if you want more food get your orders in before the movie is over Pricing is good it costs about the same as a dinner and a movie separately why NOT kill two birds with one stone and get it all at once The seats are REAL COMFORTABLE as long as you get the love seat or leather seats just don t get the office chair seats as those are like sitting in an office chair for hours watching a movie As far as sports bars go this one can t be beat You won t find one in the East Valley with better food beer selection happy hour or a friendlier staff This is hands down one of my favorite places in all of Ahwatukee and the surrounding areas I ve been here bunches of times and the only one bad experience I had overcooked burger they took care of the situation above and beyond I can t say it enough go eat drink see for yourself Public House is the best around Awesome So much better than parking on site Safe and good prices keep me coming back Flying during a busy time go to their website to make a reservation that s right a reservation Also print out a coupon for a couple bux off per day Stinkweeds shaped my formative years Really I started shopping at the now gone Tempe location when I was I had a few older friends into independent music who introduced me to this record store I begged my parents for rides and when that wasn t happening hopped on the bus for the hour long trek Totally worth it I can t tell you how many awesome bands I began listening to just because I would browse the selection endlessly for something that looked interesting If I needed something specifically Stinkweeds would order it for me if they didn t already have it in stock The staff was always welcoming and helpful sometimes offering their own suggestions But it s just a record store right Wrong Stinkweeds is the jewel of Phoenix as far as I am concerned Now that it s out in central Phoenix I make it in far less Total bummer Being from Sweden you just like salmon and at Le Chalet you can get a delicous Nordique Crepe with salmon Never had anything like that in Sweden Besides the great crepe and friendly service from the owner Alain Keller I was also treated to a laughing experience They have a comedy show twice a month Great place to eat and have a nice relaxed evening I Love Lolo s Chicken and Waffles and you will too Recently my fianc and I went to Lolo s I had heard about Lolo s and Mrs White s for years but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations When this south Scottsdale location opened I made it a point to go and try the food The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent Forget about it But don t forget about it the MAC N CHEESE is a most try The chicken is FANTABULOUS the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid Yes I said Kool Aid I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID Before this the last time I had Kool Aid was This place is very popular so you may have to wait for a table but it is well worth it This place is so popular that Sports Music Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie He did the song Just a Friend back in The only down side although the service was generally good it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like BOTTOM LINE I LEFT FULL HAPPY AND WITH A KOOL AID SMILE TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT Fantastic meal Fantastic experience I am a vegetarian I cook a lot and am very conscious of food preparation starting with sourcing I don t just patronize Farmers Markets I patronize CERTAIN Farmers Markets that sort of thing Long story short if I am going to dine out I want something very special VERY special Quiessence exceeded my expectations at almost every turn I dined there with my son and daughter in law both truly expert cooks more knowledgeable than I All of us were BLOWN AWAY by our meal We got the Farmers Feast without the wine pairings so we could choose our own wine I got the vegetarian they got the carnivore or ominvore or whatever they call it Truthfully labels are irrelevant It s all in the taste and the tastes are sublime I was impressed by how much variety was in each plate Theirs were similar but each a little different More importantly there was a marvelous progression of very carefully crafted flavors The most impressive thing The chef clearly wanted to offer his own interpretations That he did so while letting the fabulous ingredients speak for themselves is truly remarkable The setting is beautiful The servers are unpretentiously proud of their community and the work they are doing and seemed to enjoy our enjoyment as well Our only criticism and it is minor is that although the desserts were beautifully crafted we felt that they did not reflect the intentions of local sustainability There is so much wonderful local fruit used in other courses I might add perhaps adding some to the desserts would carry out the theme more completely I m sure the chefs creativity can conjure more ideas than I That said I will return As often as possible Quiessence and the Farm at South Mountain are an unparalleled resource for the Phoenix community easy to get to from any part of the Valley no excuses folks Go prepare to spend a few hours here and really have a romantic experience the food is divine the service is laid back in a good way the chef runs the whole show and plays all hats the menu is forever changing and when you make a reservation he will ask you questions so he can tailor your meal and experience to your needs probably not a good first date place because if the date goes wrong you will be stuck for a while perfect spot for an anniversary or something or even just to have a nice meal with people you know and care about This place is everything a sports bar should be Lots and lots of TV s for one I love being able to watch different sports and play trivia all at the same time The drink specials are pretty decent They re not a dollar or anything but the big beers are cheap on happy hour The food is great So far I ve only tried the spinach dip wings and their all you can eat fish chips All of them were seriously delicious These types of food are pretty standard in sports bars but I ve definitely had my fair share of unfortunate food items from other places These certainly surpassed my expectations And last but not least their star of the show Debbie One of the best bartenders I ve ever seen She runs that bar like a champ knows nearly every face that walks through that door and pours great drinks And by great I mean a good stiff drink that s not so strong that you can t taste anything else in it We frequent this place quite often and for good reason Do yourself a favor and stop in We made a last minute decision to go out on New Year s Eve The restaurant was very busy but after just a few minutes a couple of seats opened at the bar our favorite place to sit and the bar tenders Blake Kennan and Clair were ON IT They were very busy but did not miss a new face at the bar or a glass writing for a refill The food was excellent My husband had the baseball steak with twice baked potato and I had Prime Rib with lobster tail and twice baked potato Everything was cooked to perfection Oh yes Start with the garlic cheese bread as it is yummy If you re willing to run out for lunch a little early enjoy the lively patio atmosphere will dining on yummy vittles A When Harry Met Sally picky eater I um grilled the waiter on seafood s sustainability and ingredient origin and he was good natured and knowledgeable A perfect eatery for a casual date or girls day out Yay I am giving this location stars cause its been my stomping grounds for atleast years now its always very good clean and I have never had a bad experience here Wendys locations are just class acts they are always my go to burger fix I also made this my daughters first burger when she wanted to finally try one so she could have a good experience for the first one and always have a tasty burger to judge the rest by for her life If its good enough for my daughter then its good enough for you eat up and review It is sometimes difficult to start out busy and maintain great standards from the beginning The Parlor seems to be nailing it Hip yet comfortable decor Very creative design and I loved he subtle yet present homage to the former tenant Salon de Venus As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm and sincere smile and that same enthusiasm was felt by every single staff member we encountered Ah the food Fresh ingredients a great light pizza crust and an original beet salad all had us raving The only minor picky foody issue was the Nectarine Crustada for dessert was luke warm at best would have liked a nice hot dish to melt that delicious ice cream But why nit pic This place is a big hit from the moment you walk past the fresh herb and vegetable garden to the fantastic staff and the savory food this place is already on my regular rotation Everytime I think of Chodang my mouth waters I love the spicy tofu soup they serve here along with their korean style dumplings Their portions are just right If you don t like spicy foods you can tell them to not make it spicy I also love the condiments they serve before the meal Love it I like their decor The tables and walls really go together and you definitely feel like you re at an asian restaurant Everything is neat and clean even the bathrooms Had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend We both got The Farmer s Feast and it was truly amazing I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food though the hubby didn t really share too much I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here The antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses Next I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet Strawberries arugula radishes yum For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam His dish was amazing I had to fight for a couple bites For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef just lucky we each got our favorite meats Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves For dessert I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing One of the best deserts I have ever eaten Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey Just fantastic The hubby got bread pudding which we didn t much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn t try I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option Also it ended up that you got a half glass at least with each course so I think it is a good value the wine pairing was an extra I do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much However I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all Our server was extremely warm and friendly She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow however I believe that this is intentional They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself With the Farmer s Feast in particular it took us almost hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end it is six courses after all or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine It was pure food heaven This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event when you come here this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough We truly had fantastic night here One warning I will say is for ladies you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels I had been warned so had wedges In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite special occasion restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber I am not a connoisseur of cupcakes so I don t have a ton of references to use on this review That being said I m not really a big fan of cupcakes either This place is family owned and operated There s a wife and husband who run the place and the wife s sister works there also which I thought was great It is in the strip mall towards the western end of the shopping center I tried a variety of the flavors including the Reese With a spoon and a chocolate chocolate chip cupcake Coworkers that I shared them with who are cupcake aficionados really enjoyed the lemon and red velvet versions While slight pricey for a cupcake slightly north of per cupcake if you have a special occasion or just want a special treat these cupcakes are incredibly moist and delicious They also do custom cakes and cake pops though I can t speak to either of the latter two This location opened up just weeks ago and offers high quality natural products for mainly cats and dogs although there is a very basic small animal section The emphasis is on foods that are more nutritious healthier and that don t have corn or soy in them There is a large freezer section in the back with a good selection of raw food meals Also there is a plethora of treats and toys for your furry friend as well The small animal foods section has a few small bags of hay some treats pellets and toys I wasn t too impressed with their rabbit selection and they did not offer high quality brands such as Oxbow which is a bit surprising since they have so many high quality dog and cat products Jill the manager was very enthusiastic and is very passionate about providing the best products for pets She showed me various treats foods and toys and provided a lot of educational material on dog nutrition and health She provided a free sample of some nice grain free dry dog kibble which is highly recommended on dogfoodadvisor com which I appreciated a lot since my dog is a bit picky with the food he eats This is definitely a place to go to spoil and pamper your dog or cat This star rating is mostly for their boba They are cool about how many flavors I put into my boba usually about unlike other boba shops that only allow like Their ramen is pretty good and decently priced However I don t like coming to this place much ONLY because I don t like coming out smelling like an Asian restaurant This place is great I really appreciate the extreme friendliness and kindness of the employees Best customer service Also the variety of favors is fantastic Wow these cupcakes were amazing The frosting was picture perfect I tried Vanilla Salted Caramel and Pumpkin and both were so good The cake on both were super dense and moist Vanilla Salted Caramel definitely was the best of the two We recently took a weekend getaway to Phoenix and stayed here The Hotel is beautiful and our rooms were spacious and very comfortable The staff here are topnotch I love the lobby wine hot apple cider hour in the afternoons and the lobby coffee hot chocolate bars in the mornings We had access to the Golds Gym across from the hotel and were able to get a good workout in their cardio theatre There is an outdoor skating rink right outside and a small shopping dining area It is located right across from the stadium and could walk to our event I would definitely recommend staying here especially if you are attending an event at the arena I had lunch there recently and was very impressed with the food friendly service and excellent value I had a lunch special two cheeseburger sliders with sweet potato fries They serve the burgers with several pieces of fresh crisp lettuce tomato and onion We will definitely go there again wow this place is a gem highly recommend it if you re looking for a great place to take a date or chill with some friends out in the patio over some wine visited friends in the phoenix area over thanksgiving vacation and they took us here on a Saturday night i dont know much about the chandler area but this place could easily rival any of the popular wine lounges here in san diego as for food our group ordered a bunch of the bruschettas flatbreads and a couple sandwiches to share family style we all enjoyed all of it i especially recommend the fig chutney that was absolutely amazing from the sandwiches the shrimp blt definitely stuck out as my favorite overall everything was very good and the service was great as for the wine great selection the staff was very helpful in helping us pick out the perfect bottle based on what we like in fact i think i found my new favorite wine thanks to them if you re a wino like me you ll love this place as for the ambiance they nailed it awesome patio and great decor the attention to detail is definitely noticeable very chill spot ps check out the door to their wine cellar i want that in my house it s gorgeous If I could only eat at one place for the rest of my life it would have to be at FnB This is ultimate comfort food for me with the bulk of the menu highlighting local in season organic vegetables from McClendon and other local farms Charleen prepares dishes that pay the ultimate homage to the vegetable and the farmer with perfect seasoning contrast balance and temperatures Beyond vegetables the housemade burrata was light as a cloud and shrimp grilled to perfection on the mesquite Dishes at FnB are simple but often the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right as there is nothing to hide behind ingredients have to be fresh and of the highest quality and execution must be perfect Charleen and her crew strike it out of the park almost every time Service is professional attentive and friendly Pavle and his team make you feel right at home which is the other reason why I would happily eat here everyday For the past ten years ever since FunSports occupied the same unit this place has been the one stop shop for my biking needs From BMX at age to road cycling in adulthood SMC usually has what I m looking for The prices don t really compete with larger chains like Performance but they are reasonable and the service more than makes up for the difference When I was getting into road cycling the guys at the shop were very helpful with selection fit and pricing A I indulged big time at Indulge Burgers More during Fat Tuesday yesterday There are a tremendous variety including many healthy options such as a turkey or veggie burger The best part I like is that you can build your own burger with all sorts of yummy toppings I had the turkey burger and the turkey was one of the best I have ever tasted Sometimes you can taste like of the darker meats and fatty parts but I felt like this burger was very clean and lean I would highly recommend the sweet potatoe fries that you can order You can deep those fries in what tastes like a warm marshamallow dip The price is not too bad either for what I call a luxury burger Fez is RIGHT down the street from where I work hence due to its location general fabulousness it has become a regular spot for happy hour Here s What we LOVE about Fez Sweet Potato Fries sooo good sprinkled with cinnamon by the way Kisra and Hummus The Black Bean Burger the first time I ordered it I asked the server Now is this one of those really bad black bean burgers or does it actually taste good She said I totally know what you mean no this one is good and she was right Margarita Mondays aka for one Margaritas check out the pomegranate one The atmosphere blue and green tones while still being warm The friendly service The close proximity to light rail Here s what we don t like as much The slow service sometimes it gets kind of bad I feel like you have to be an active restaurant goer and hail down your server otherwise you may never get to order get more water another drink or get your check When happy hour ends I mean who likes that anywhere Fez makes me very happy to work in downtown Phoenix Steak cooked to perfection Been a patron since this eatery first opened This is honestly one restaurant that has not been hurt by the economy The food is that fabulous My absolute favorite salad is the Turkey Waldorf My children always get the side Caesar with Potato Cream Cheese Soup The husband always gets either a Cranberry Scone and Onion Bagel slathered with cream cheese OR a Pretzel and some sort of sandwich The only downside to this eatery is their lack of seating space during the lunch rush hour Get there by am if you actually want to sit inside otherwise on a windy and cold winter day you might find yourself outside sitting on the patio as I have done in the past Even with the lack of seating during rush hour lunch I m giving this place five stars and making sure I m there before the rush hour Happy Eats Been a loyal customer since they opened ten years ago Quality cut and great people These are professional barbers who have been doing this for years No froo froo Russian not spoken there I m so happy this store is located so close to my house Every time I come to this store I get great service I mainly use this store to get food items for my dog or the grooming salon where Zombi has never had a bad experience This location also has a Banfield Vet Hospital PetsHotel Doggie Day Camp Training services and at times has adoptions My best friend has used both the PetsHotel and the Doggie Day Camp for her pooch and has never had a bad experience I also used the Banfield Vet to get Zombi up to date on her Rabies and the Vet was super nice The best part was that I didn t even have an appointment I just walked in and they were able to fit me in after a five minute wait My only pet peeve pun intended is there is usually only one cashier working and the line can get pretty long However it doesn t take long for another employee to open up another line to speed up the check out experience AND they usually show up on their own without customers complaining about only having one cashier Bonus Some of the best Italian food I have ever had This is a favorite for my wife and I Sima and Marcellino are very nice people very inviting The bar is small but fun to hang out at The food is always fresh and delicious Watch out for Marcellino he likes to push the truffles I took my computer to RedSeven recently when my friends were calling and telling me I had a nasty virus that was sending out gobs of email every fifteen mins I had no idea my computer was infected I was hesitant to do so because I needed my computer to do some work No worries the fellas over at RedSeven hooked me up with a loaner I was able to get online and get my work done and get my home PC back the next day without missing a beat I was going to take my computer to one of those BIG BOX store repair places I am so glad I didnt A friend of mine took their PC there and when it came back all of their family pictures music and email was gone I will only be using RedSeven in the future and I suggest you do the same I have completed this run obviously not the th annual edition times now The course is always the same a bit hillier than other Papgo courses as it takes a right along the sidewalk behind the zoo but the organization is always excellent The t shirt is another good draw to this event a long sleeve shirt that changes color in the sun There is always food at the end a raffle and a great crowd One of the best events on the racing calendar each year and an excellent way to start the new year off right This is a GREAT place to eat One of my favorite lunch stops as you can see if you follow my facebook photos Lunch With Stew My favorite thing there is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza mmmmm mmm Kevin O Donnell is from the Texas Hold em family of final tables and occasionally will play the tour Super great guy and he also has a super great restaurant and sports bar stars all the way Let me begin by saying that I m a big fan of the products The store is done in very warm tones and the drinks are incredibly aromatic and these things combines seem to make all my stress melt away when I step in the door I m not a huge coffee fan but I can order some of the coffee drinks here I m completely unable to drink the caramel frappuccino from Starbucks but I can t get enough of the caramel ice blended from Coffee Bean Tea Leaf So now that we ve established that I love the product we can move on to the real reason this place gets a star review the staff I ve never seen anything like it If you come in times someone will probably know your name and might even know your drink Leila is the best at this She knows peoples names their drinks and if you come there often enough she even knows which car you drive She ll see a regular customer s car pull up and she ll have the normal drink ready and waiting for them by the time they walk through the door THAT is the epitome of customer service Not only does this place get it s ingredients directly from Italy it makes a variety of flavors fresh daily I got my first taste of gelato when I visited Rome Italy a few years back I ve tried other gelato spots around the U S but nothing has caught my AMORE or the authentic Italian flavor more than Angel Sweet So far my favorite combo is the most popular Panna Cotta with Banana which an employee recommended Hazelnut and Pistachio as well as SUPER Dark Chocolate again with the Panna Cotta Don t forget your punch card buy and get one kid s size free Yes the place is busy every time I go there and it takes minutes or so to get your order Yes the inside is cheesy and cheap with folding tables and could definitely use a makeover Yes the location is ummm well lets just say its a working class neighborhood BUT they ve got the best fish tacos I ve ever had and everything on their Mexico City street food style menu is outstanding The tacos are mini tacos so get or of them a couple of fish tacos maybe a side of rice and or beans and you will be all set Go there Just leave yourself plenty of time it s well worth the wait This place is perfect Great food great service and friendly people We will be back over and over again We ordered a few different things on the menu and all were excellent Stetson chopped salad scallops testosterone salad Lovvvve it The Harkins Camelview gives Arizonans the unique opportunity to see movies that are normally reserved for screens in NY and CA Without this theater there would be very little chance to see independent or foreign films in Phoenix I give a lot of credit to Dan Harkins for keeping this theater open He certainly can t make much money at this location It s financially impractical to keep such a small theater operating on such prime real estate This just shows Dan Harkin s commitment to sharing great films with the people of AZ Thanks Dan Going to Desert Botanical Garden is the perfect field trip for a beautiful day like today I ve been to DBG a handful of times for events exhibit openings meetings and of course Yelp In Bloom a yelper party that I planned a couple of years ago but today I went with my son and we met some other friends with the sole purpose of checking out the butterfly exhibit We didn t get lucky enough to have a butterfly land on us but we did see tons of gorgeous butterflies There were orange butterflies and yellow butterflies and striped butterflies etc The flowers in the pavillion are pretty to look at as well We visited the gift kiosk afterward and took home a butterfly finger puppet which I know we will get tons of use from only The exhibit runs until May th so don t miss it And if you do find yourself with more time while you re there definitely check out the design for a living world exhibit as well I saw that when it first opened and it was really cool The photography alone is worth a visit I just wish I had more time to explore DBG more often Obligatory stop for a drink Dodey is here so that is always good Recently ordered Spinato s again and just had to update to stars as much as I ve always loved NYPD I have to admit that this really is the best pizza I ve had in the valley It s not fair to compare the two as they re totally different styles but it s just so good And they re local Can t beat it After a night of debauchery with friends my friend and I found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of Pho I ve been a regular at Cyclo s for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new I was pleasantly surprised with Pho Ao Sen I am always happy when I enter an Asian restaurant and see Asians patrons probably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes The tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed The decor had a modern Asian feel minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing perfect for a Sunday afternoon We ordered the Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien House PHO nomenal House special combination of sliced eye round steak well done brisket well done flank soft tendon tripe and beef meatball and the Pho Tai Sliced eye round steak and Goi Cuon Spring Rolls As with most Vietnamese restaurants the portion size of Pho is quite large and we could have shared Both were delicious filling and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering I ve experienced a few places that use a little too much anise so much that you can t get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation The Spring Rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the Pho I give Pho Ao Sen stars Best Pho I ve had in the valley beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl Spotted Donkey Cantina is amazing They have delicious Mexican food and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with You do have to pay for chips and salsa here so there probably won t be any of that four bowl snacking before your main entree s come but the medley of salsa s it comes with make it all worth it I ve tried quite a few of the dishes here and they ve all been excellent In no particular order are my favorites cheddar enchilada s with hatch chiles and rice spicy santa fe macaroni and cheese again spicy cod and shrimp tostada s delicious shrimp fajitas shrimp tacos And for dessert fried banana wraps or the mango margarita sundae Pita Jungle is a staple favorite of mine and my boyfriend s Healthy hearty and great service It s too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up as have other restaurants but I ll still patronize this place Read as some things went up in price almost two dollars but you can still have a meal and a drink for around more or less depending on what you order I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern there s something about being by the lake that makes it special Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time Ooh and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place Every time we drive by he wants to go in and eat Even if we are driving home from a dinner we just had The people that work there are AMAZING They are so nice and hospitable always glad to see you and let you decide the type of dining experience you want romantic date take out quick bar eats etc This is the freshest place for seafood I have found in Phoenix I don t know how they find half of the stuff the serve but they do and it is just off the boat I lived in Boston for years and they get stuff I crave like Kumomato Oysters all types of fish and meat from East Coast farms Pricing is right on since they are serving stuff that is difficult to procure I am always amazed at the value they present Keep Rocking Yasu When cowboys ride off into the sunset they probably stop at Greasewood Flat for a burger and beer This rustic little bar is located a bit outside the city right near Pinnacle Peak and is definitely worth the drive You ll know you are in the right spot when you see the antique farm equipment and suddenly feel like you are walking up to an Old West saloon Say hello to the mule on your way in Outside they have picnic tables horseshoes and fire pits gets chilly out there in the desert and on the weekends they have live music and dancing Inside the bar is pretty small and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals For the nights without live music don t you fret they have a jukebox with tons of country hits The night we went it was the bartender s birthday and the regulars were definitely having a good time Both a historic landmark year old original stagecoach stop and a dive bar Greasewood Flat is clearly special to Arizona and is a definite must see I ll be going back on a weekend to get the true Greasewood Flat experience and hopefully see a cute cowboy or two Full disclosure one way or another I have only been to Roaring Fork for the Happy Hour but the happy hour is darn good You can and you should get that kettle of green chili pork or the big ass burger or better yet share the two with someone nice The huckleberry margarita is so good I ve had three in one sitting no I wasn t driving I fully intend to get over there for dinner soon because I keep seeing the sugar cured duck on the menu and just thinking about it right now my mouth is watering It gets pretty busy during the happy hour though so be prepared to wait a little if your party is large I wish that this place were not so good I have not been able to drink the coffee at my office in weeks The location that One Coffee occupies used to be a coffee shop graveyard Several coffee houses went out of business in this location unable to compete with Starbucks One Coffee has bucked that trend and it is not hard to see why One Coffee has great coffee and it is amazingly consistent The staff is always friendly This place is certainly doing something right everytime I go in there it has more and more customers chomp this is one mmmghgh good burger sllluuuurrrpp It s got a great combination of yumminess with a side of chomp awesomeness The burgers are great and chomp perfect The custard is great lick and diabetic friendly mmmmmmm They have no sugar added custard i would definitely recommend this place lick Primp and Blow at the Waterfront is divine I walked out feeling like a Super Model without spending a fortune Great Stylists Upbeat Friendly atmosphere Great Tunes and an overall GREAT VIBE Convenient Parking and centrally located right near Fashion Square and Olive and Ivy LOVE it This is a brand new delicatessen who s grand opening was September th Since I don t have a kitchen in my place this re heat one stop shop near my neighborhood will be a place I plan to frequent via walking They have a cute cook book lounge and the deli layout is fun to just paroose Their chocolate chip cookies taste home made So nice to still feel like you have some input in the cooking preparation process when you live with just a microwave I live within walking distance of the Japanese Friendship Garden so I enjoy it frequently Once inside it s hard to believe you re still in Phoenix That s why I was so happy when Groupon recently offered a half price membership I would join in a minute except they re closed from May to October or so Half price membership seems about right The atmosphere is gentle and meditative I feel safe sitting on a bench and actually meditating here The koi kind of freak me out They ve been fed so often by visitors that I feel fairly certain they d eat me if I fell into the pond Last time I visited there were baby ducks in the house So cute and fluffy and they had no fear of people I have lived all over the US and I have experienced extreme lows and highs with dentists but this dental group is by far my favorite I have ever been a patient of I can t say enough good about them so I won t ramble Just love them Grew up in San Antonio and Austin Have traveled extensively and sampled BBQ all over the country The term Texas style means beef first Period And good smoke and that ain t mesquite Oak is king These guys have changed the face of Phoenician BBQ forever It s a shame that the Scottsdale location was touched by well Scottsdale Friggin morons If you have not been here you need to go down to th and E Roeser and try it Hands down the best Q in the area including Cave Creek The guys are FROM Texas and they know the whats wheres and hows of Bar B Que And for those the meal in a carton on butcher paper snobs who think that such is declasse please do me a favor Head on down to Austin or better yet Lockhart Stand at the front of the line at Stubbs or Black s or Kruez Market and loudly proclaim your thoughts as a BBQ aficionado Just let me know when you are heading down so I can hang out and watch the ensuing festivities Freud said it best BBQ and being horrifically anally retentive is ALL about your unfulfilled dreams of your Auntie Ma Or shut up and grow up ya infantile gomers Do Taco Jedis work at Senor Taco Yes Yes they do Is the force of making killer fast Mexican food strong with these Jedis Oh hell yeah Try the shredded beef tacos in the hard shells When they ask you if you want hot sauce say si and drizzle it mightily onto the tacos Piled cheese beef lettuce tomatoes all stuffed into an authentic style taco shell it doesn t get any better than this Just make sure you put a helmet on because it s crazy good If you like spicy no nonsense burritos go with the Carne Asada Burrito Red Chile If you like the whole meal go with the Carne Asada or Pollo Asado burrito combo plates The plate comes with flour tortillas beans and rice guacamole and salsa fresca You make your own burritos This is just good eatin Take it home crack open a good Hefeweizen and you are golden And lastly from the sage words of my wife The shrimp tacos and burritos are certified gourmet meals Do I stutter Nope While Senor Taco is technically fast food it does take some time to prepare If you do drive thru don t get all road ragey if it takes longer than it does at Taco Bell There is a price to pay to make good food and that price is TIME This is not a worldwide chain that spends more on advertising and earning your business by putting cute little dogs on plastic mugs Senor Taco is not that type of place A little wait is very much worth it I realize that appearance of the location irks some reviewers Yes it is in a strip mall Yes it is feet away from a gas station slash AM PM mini market I get that But this is not Sanctuary This is not Kai This is not Deseo When one reviewer and I use the word reviewer loosely here hilariously claims to have walked in used his Superman vision to supposedly spot a family of offending microbes and without trying the food proceeded to sprint out because he was frightened of all the imagined cooties well I just have to laugh That s not a review it s a drive by and reviewers like this are probably happier with Hometown Buffet or Luby s Cafeteria And that s too bad because this is excellent fast food I ve eaten here maybe times and my wife has ordered the fish taco plate a number of times and neither of us has ever gotten sick The people at Senor Taco are nice the food pleasantly surprises and your expectation of fast Mexican food will be forever changed for the better I can t recommend highly enough Stopped in looking for some break from the heat after a couple hours shopping They have a happy hour menu that we tried several dishes from and all were very good Menu also has a good selection of alcoholic drinks nut we stuck to H O hydration instead Staff and management were very attentive Would definitely recommend Like they even need another review they have a solid stars as it is Just got back from my first visit to Adobe and I am beyond impressed My German Shepherd pup was having some stomach issues over the holidays so I decided to have him checked out to be on the safe side I knew he didn t have an obstruction or other emergency issue but I was concerned about parasites The receptionist Hilary was super sweet on the phone and in person She was upfront with what tests she thought would be ordered and how much it would run me and it wasn t an arm and a leg the office call was only I was very happy they d be able to see me the next morning but then she called back not minutes later with a cancellation and said to come on in Even better The tech was very good with Nately s pounds of squirming and loved on him the whole time I was also happy they let me help hold him I ve been to vets that called in a nd tech like the owners aren t capable of safely holding their own dog Okay maybe some aren t but I am and I appreciate being able to and not being instructed like a child Dr Newland was AWESOME The difference between him and some other vets I ve been to Other vets Oh my God we need to run worth of expensive tests and start him on multiple medications general sense of admonishment for not rushing him to their affiliated ER clinic eagerness to run the bill up very few questions about anything etc Dr Newland Super calm and personable He spent minutes going over everything Nately s last few days of activity and stomach issues diet contact with other dogs where I take him in public anything he could think of really felt his abdomen thoroughly and said Honestly he s a puppy they eat funny things and something probably just irritated his stomach He s plainly feeling pretty good so just feed him a bland diet give him this medication to settle his stomach and bring a stool sample just in case so you know for sure he s parasite free He also dispensed advice for Nately s general care as long as we were there about heartworm prevention and necessary vaccines etc I even got a good education on the different types of parasites and which were even likely in AZ s climate turns out not many I really appreciated that he didn t try to frighten me into expensive diagnostics and possible serious diseases and that he is so on his game and scientific logical about things I am very impressed and will be making Adobe my regular vet for as long as possible If only they treated birds too When I think Royal Palms I think romantic getaway A quaint yet exquisite resort the Royal Palms was built in to emulate a colonial Spanish retreat Colonial as in when the Spaniards were conquering the New World All of the historical details are presented on a frescoed wall in one of the courtyards We had heard some great things about J Cook s and decided to spend a leisurely Sunday morning dining on the patio If you re looking to be treated like royalty you want to dine here I enjoyed exploring the hotel after a luxe breakfast at J Cooks The staff are incredibly accomodating What an ideal location for an intimate stay cation It s a nice place to go to grab some drinks and appetizers I will definitely be back to see what more the resort has to offer I m not sure why it has taken me so long to actually go inside Go Kat Go but I finally did and loved it This store is filled with all sorts of great retro Hawaiian treasures along with a plethora of other gems We ve got locally designed clothing in one corner awesome furniture in another tons of handmade accessories in the middle and bunches of fun throughout It was really hard not to pick up everything in this store and buy it The owner was really nice and offered to hold our stuff while we shopped I ended up walking out of there with an awesome Dia de los Muertos pillow that looks amazing on my new couch plus a matching potholder oven mitt set in a really cool pattern I will definitely be back especially since my other mom s b day is coming up and she loves this kind of stuff Culinary Dropout is a fantastic place to eat The interior is very rocker complete with stage for bands interesting and yummy food with an array of beers and amazing food If you decide to go which I don t know why you wouldn t try their monkey bread for dessert it is to die for OK guys and gals too I know size isn t everything but OMG this place has crazy size portions and I loooove it We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms orders and STILL the servings were huge Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer They were great and tasty but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that The calamari was decent could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce but for those who don t like a lot of fan fare with their food this would be perfect classic calamari with classic sauce We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim just how I like them For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni D Both of them were absolutely fantastic yumm And both were HUGE The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in very smart For those with little ones the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well Their chicken fingers are home made the pickiest of adults would eat these things no french fries home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets This is the KIDS menu Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding Great leather booths linen napkins white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth elegant but not stuffy Guys could go in with t shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up you can as well with out feeling overly so I am definitely going here again what a find What can I say This is awesome I am a donut fan and would give Dunkin stars just like this place Great variety great coffee fresh donuts The extra star comes for the fluffiness of their dough Its very fluffy and its done just right Dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and old when they have been sitting for a while For some reason the Bosa donuts dun get too hard even after U buy and drive for like hour home I know its not located in the best part of town but they are open hrs and there is a drive thru They accept credit cards and discover Lee Lee s finally expanded from their Chandler location for us who have loyally driven an hour to shop Low prices huge selection and it only took like a week for the place to smell like a true Asian market i e wherever you are you will never escape the smell of fish I love it I bought ingredients for Vietnamese spring rolls two different kinds of curries a new motor pestle a Vietnamese coffee press and some various other vegetables and liquors hardly anything Also the seafood while I didn t purchase any looks very fresh Wonderful to see such a great addition to west Phoenix I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paws Salon I used to take my dog to Canine Preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey so I thought I d try a new place and I am SO glad I did The owner Tracy clearly has a passion for animals Walking in you are greeted by a cat dog and Macaw that call the front of the shop home You are able to see them grooming the dogs a big plus for me you never know what some places do behind closed doors She is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady in a good way She s to the point tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help They keep track of the previous cut that was given it s annoying some places you to have to tell them every time I would highly recommend this pet salon They also offer daycare and overnight boarding I can t want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more Can t go wrong at this salon Say hello to the Ghost Lounge folks This is a brand new bar located right next to Seamus within the San Carlos through an agreement with the hotel s ownership For years I ve thought the Hotel San Carlos was an under appreciated through its own fault downtown venue With the Ghost the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown Phoenix scene This is apparent from the first step inside the lobby which appears as it did in when the hotel first opened If celebrities in the s had to spend the night in Phoenix back then a small un airconditioned cowboy town with around they would have stayed here Or else the near by Westward Ho You get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blow ups the Ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early th century downtown Phoenix So large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets and marvel at their bowties cowboy hats handkerchiefs and facial expressions Back then the San Carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was air cooled That may have meant it had swamp coolers I haven t googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review I d describe the bar s style as grandiose and classic old school Phoenix with an obligatory hint of Chicago obligatory given the decades old economic relationship betweeen the two cities that endures to this day It has been beautifully done I will be back often I love this gym Everyone is so helpful and friendly The gym has a TON of equipment and is always very well kept and clean I wouldn t want to go anywhere else I feel very well connected to all of the staff they even know me by name The trainers are extremely helpful also I would recommend this gym to anyone and everyone I love this place It first caught my eye driving to work Their logo includes a shazzam lighting bolt which is rad if your into comics I went in the place and they had comic art on the walls The staff made some suggestions of what I should try I got the slider pizza kinda like a cheese burger pizza they actually used a little brown mustard on top Anyway it was delicious I can t get over the helpful staff though It is very rare that I get that kind of service at a pizza joint Any way every time I have visited the place there has been no patrons and it breaks my heart because that is a good sign that it isn t going to be around long If you get the change PLEASE check this place out Pulled pork over rice with compelling seasoned tater tots rosemary garlic Gutsy sauce was utterly unique Darryl King prepared it hot and packaged it with style for takeaway service Yogurtland as I say it with a high pitched tone in the end This is my ultimate favorite dessert I would give stars if Yelp allows it All my friends know that I am attached to this place We started this craziness together with my better half when we tried it a few years back after a basketball game and all I said after first walking in was This is fun and we got hooked eversince That I collect their spoons only used by me and the hubbie and I now have YGL cups full of spoons I am the ultimate Yogurtland addict heehee We go as often as times a week that we already know the staff in this location And we go that often that we even tried to abstain from it for Lent just to see if we can resist it haha Most of our friends also keep on asking to try other fro yo places to see if something will beat my YGL addiction and so far nothing has won over it yet D So my favorite flavors are Taro Pistachio and Toasted Coconut and the of course the seasonal flavors Pumpkin Pie Gingerbread Oh I wanna go now just thinking about it My favorite toppings are the yogurt chips sugar cone sunflower seeds shredded coconut and graham Perfect blend of flavors So if you haven t tried it yet grab your favorite partner and enjoy some Yogurtland Sara bartender is the hottest chick in the world If you ve never had or even heard of bingsoo you NEED to check this place out I have two friends who were constantly bantering about bingsoo and this Fresco place I was excited when I found out it was so close to my house If you ve never heard of it this is how it goes down It s a layer of shaved ice then you have your choice of ice cream or FF frozen yogurt your choice of fresh fruit off the menu apples strawberry mango banana kiwi and many others and then your choice of sauce which is a fruit puree of either strawberry kiwi or mango and honey You mix it all together and there you have it A somewhat healthy dessert They even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card This place isn t just all about the bingsoo though They have a menu of fresh sandwiches and fruit juices too I have to tell you I had their Jerk Chicken Plate the other night and it was yuuuuummmmmyyy You gotta try it I was in Vietnam last May and spent every summer in Westminster CA growing up so to qualify my stars Woohoo As good as it gets I say to what s available of what I ve seen in PHX area With that said I ve had the Bun Bo Hue Pho Tai Com Tam Dac Biet Bun bi cha gio and agree with what everyone said about cleanliness freshness of condiments integrity of broth lack of oiliness and general flavor The only thing that didn t rock my world was the bahn mi sandwiches can t vouch for the assorted outsourced items in the chilled section either Besides that If you want Viet food this is your place for the PHX metro area I tired they chicken smash burger WOOHOO LOVE IT Crispy chicken not too think not too thick but perfectly crispy I ordered the build your own Egg bun crispy chicken mayo and swiss cheese HELLO MAMA The smash fries were good The staff is always friendly Pei Wei s has nothing on the fabulous food at TOTTS The menu is awesome try anything The owner Young is such a nice man and will always help you understand the menu or make recommendations In fact one time we told him we wished a certain dish was spicier we really like hotttt food and he told us to just ask next time we were in and they would make it spicier Everything on the menu is fabulous but some of my favorites are Sweet and Pungent Chicken all time favorite Bourban Chicken Twins Pork Headed back to Lobby s How I missed this tasty burger I wasn t disappointed with round The burger was still fantastic I m also happy that the fries were a little bit less salty than my previous trip With any burger purchase getting the combo pack fries soda is the smart choice I do wish that they would lose the styrofoam soda cups and offer more than one size of drinks Make sure to grab plenty of napkins before you sit down The burger can make a mess with the homemade sauce dripping off the meat and bun That s a good thing in my opinion This is one excellent Ethiopian restaurant rivals anything I ve sampled in Washington DC or Seattle If I lived in Phoenix this would be a Top restaurant for me along with Lo Lo s Chicken Waffles yum Lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu Many of the entrees are offered as small portions each They suggest each diner order of these to make a meal Kitfo and Lamb Tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many Ethiopian restaurants you can order combo plates meat combo veggie combo house combo plate etc This made deciding on our meal a little more complicated but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes Our favorite dish ordered was the Lamb Tibs the spicy version with Awaze spice paste Lamb was soooo tender and the spices were a delight rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes Good thing it comes as a full order four of us were competing for bites We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott beef in a spicy brown sauce that was some of the best I ve ever had Again rich in flavor but not too spicy My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo choice beef sort of like steak tartar servered raw or lightly cooked but with Ethiopian spices Lalibela s was pretty good just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent especially the yellow lentils gomen collard greens and spicy Wott lentils Staff was great attentive helpful service Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants this one is very user friendly Although in some cases the menu accommodates American tastes it doesn t compromise on quality or authenticity One note on the injera sponge like bread used to scoop up the entrees it s a mix of wheat flour and teff a grain indigenous to Ethiopia and I don t think it s fermented like injera that is made with teff I m used to the latter but you can argue Lalibela s injera doesn t compete with the flavor of the entrees as much All in all one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I ve been to and I have been to many in the States Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good Highly highly recommended My favorite sushi restaurant ever I love their ama ebi nigiri sweet shrimp and always craving for more For this visit I tried their dynamite scallop roll and salmon roll with asparagus inside and it was so delicious makes me craving for more The pork ribs were very delicate and it was melting in your mouth What makes this restaurant to be my number one spot of Japanese restaurant in the valley was the sushi chef service is superb They ran out ama ebi and I told the waitress that one of the reason I came there is for that ama ebi The chef suddenly came back to me one hour later and said he saved one ama ebi for me What a service I m so thankful of this wonderful dining experience and will definitely become one of their regular customer Love this place so much I find it hilarious that someone would reference this place as being terrible compare it to overpriced and bland Humble Pie and in the same breath say it was the best chili relleno you ever tasted I can t vouch for the chicken tacos but most street tacos are nowhere near packed with meat By definition they are usually very tiny with onions some guacamole a little cabbage and some small cuts of meat I can say the tilapia tacos are tops large filet on each on the list of my girlfriend s quest for good fish tacos I can say the pork nachos are the best I have had as the pork reminds me of Los Dos Molinos in a small way The empanadas are excellent as well If you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for bucks You can also get large fish tacos for bucks Would you like some awesome tortilla soup bucks If you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans I think it sets you back about bucks I have also had the chili relleno and it is the best I have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything why the venom I learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first When I asked they said the chili relleno pork empanadas and red sangrias Guess how my dining experience went Try ordering tacos from Los Dos Molinos and you will leave pissed Order the green chili pork and you will drive miles for it I do hope you give it another chance I have honestly never had anything sub par here in my or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do I agree that Main Ingredient is great also that s why I took the time to write about it But to reiterate dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip on the list to try is not pricey happy hour has most items for street tacos are not bursting with meat ask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want Humble Pie was more pricey and not worth it All it does is take up parking from a much better place next door For a place with the reference to pizza in it s name you would think it would be better it tasted like peter piper I would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuy s but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle ranch like sauce which is similar My profile says My Last Meal On Earth Chicken and Waffles Lo Lo s is the reason why Everytime I visit Arizona I make sure I hit this spot up I usually order the Lo Lo s meal which comes with pieces of fried chicken with waffles and a scoop of butter with syrup YUM This meal would not be complete without ordering their super delicious Sweet Tea which is served in a glass jar There are two locations one in lower Phoenix and the other in Scottsdale The one in lower Phoenix is the original location However it s much smaller so wait times could vary The Scottsdale location is much bigger so dealing with long wait times should not be as big of a problem Winner Winner Chicken Dinner Lunch and Breakfast please I first joined hr fitness about a year ago and I have had nothing but good experiences with the staff since the first day that I came in The people behind the front desk have always been very kind and attentive to my needs If I ever have a question or concern it is always promptly answered or dealt with Some of them have even taken the time to learn my name and greet me as soon as I walk in the door It is very impressive and makes for a very pleasant experience On another note I have been training with Trace for about months now My goal was to lose a little bit of weight and tone up my body and I could not be happier with the results In months I have lost lbs and I look and feel amazing He is incredibly knowledgeable about training and nutrition giving his clients hard workouts as well as meal plans Trace is the total package TIP Try Trace s boot camp on Wednesday evenings at They will kick your butt The staff is great the food is great even the cappuccino is great had my first one today i work close by and I have a choice where to eat and it s very often Acacia for breakfast and lunch A few of my favs are Chicken Salad Sandwich Southwest Ranch Salad Omelets Enjoy maybe I ll run into you there Highly recommend This is my second time here and I see on the way I ve had the bistec encebollado arroz imperial with shrimp no melted cheese I do recommend both plates Next time I will try ropa vieja Great service Ask for Kelly Yes I do rock the hipster joints I dig this place A little bit of a scene but the food is solid and the service is great Hard not like it All in all a great spot I tend to switch up my favorites but I typically hit this up for breakfast when in the Let s see what is there NOT to like about Surprise Stadium Well tall cans of PBR is about all I could come up with and that s not a surprise pun intended considering you re attending a sporting event even spring training But as someone who does not living in Arizona and as someone who doesn t go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here Look you re lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost MLB baseball right in your back yard If I could I d live down here during March just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the Phoenix metro area each year I attended my first spring training game on March th at Surprise Stadium as the Royals took on the San Francisco Giants my favorite team Our seats Sec Row J Seats were bucks each around bucks including service fees I mean we were maybe or rows back from the Giants dugout check out some of my pictures The stadium funny calling it that since it only holds just over people is big enough so you feel you re at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean Arriving to the park I was surprised pun unintended to see that parking was free an oddity when going to an event like this The stadium staff as mentioned by other reviews are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful I didn t have to wait long at the concession stands even if lines were a bit long The outfield is lined with a lawn area perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game Tickets are around bucks each after service fees I love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family Oh Giants won Go Giants '"
